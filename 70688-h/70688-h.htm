<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">I have undertaken to write the life of the old
Rajah, Sir James Brooke, my first and only
chief, as one of the Builders of Greater Britain.
In his case the expression must be used in its
widest sense, as, in fact, he added but an inappreciable
fragment to the Empire, whilst at
the same time he was the cause of large
territories being included within our sphere of
influence. And if his advice had been followed,
we should not now be troubled with the restless
ambition of France in the Hindu-Chinese
regions, as his policy was to secure, by well
defined treaties, the independence of those
Asiatic States, subject, however, to the beneficent
influence of England as the Paramount Power,
an influence to be used for the good of the
governed. Sir James thoroughly understood
that Eastern princes and chiefs are at first only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
influenced by fear; the fear of the consequences
which might follow the neglect of the counsels
of the protecting State.</p>

<p>The plan which the Rajah endeavoured to
persuade the English Government to adopt
was to make treaties with all the independent
princes of the Eastern Archipelago, including
those States whose shores are washed by the
China Sea, as Siam, Cambodia and Annam, by
which they could cede no territory to any
foreign power without the previous consent of
England, and to establish at the capitals of the
larger States well-chosen diplomatic agents, to
encourage the native rulers not only to improve
the internal condition of their countries, but to
inculcate justice in their treatment of foreigners,
and thus avoid complications with other powers.</p>

<p>Sir James Brooke first attempted to carry out
this enlightened policy by concluding treaties
with the Sultans of Borneo and Sulu, to secure
these States from extinction; the latter treaty
was not ratified, however, owing to the timidity
of a naval officer, foolishly influenced by a
clever Spanish Consul in Singapore, who took
advantage of the absence of the Rajah. In
the forties and fifties the expansion of Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span>
Britain, as is well known, was looked upon
with genuine alarm by many of our leading
statesmen.</p>

<p>Sir James Brooke, however, was not destined
to see the fufilment of his ideas, as a ministry
came into power in 1853 which cared nothing
for the Further East, and in the hope of consolidating
their majority in Parliament sacrificed
their noble officer to appease the clamour raised
by Joseph Hume and his followers, who, like
other zealots, pursued their objects regardless
of all the evidence which could be brought
to refute their unfounded accusations. Joseph
Hume may be called a libeller by profession,
who began his career by making his fortune in
the East India Company’s service in a very few
years—a remarkable achievement; and who
afterwards, when in Parliament, brought himself
into notoriety by attacking first Sir Thomas
Maitland, secondly Lord Torrington, and
ultimately Sir James Brooke, whose shoe
latchets he was unworthy to unloose.</p>

<p>Sir James had thus but a short career as an
English official. He was named Confidential
Agent in 1845, Commissioner and Consul-General
in 1846, Governor of Labuan in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>
1847, and his return to England in 1851
practically closed his active political connection
with England, though he did not resign all his
offices until 1854.</p>

<p>But the Rajah did not thus conclude his own
career; he returned to Sarawak and devoted all
his energies to the development of his adopted
country, and of the neighbouring districts. I
shall have to relate what extraordinary vicissitudes
of fortune he had to encounter, and
how after many years of conflict he emerged
triumphant, to leave to his successor, Sir Charles
Brooke, a small kingdom, well organised as far
as Sarawak was concerned, with strongly established
positions reaching to Bintulu, which have
but increased in influence and in power to
further the well-being of the natives of every
race and class; and to prove to all who care to
interest themselves in the subject, what a gain
to humanity has resulted from the old Rajah
having had the courage and the forethought
to found his rule in a wild country, whose
inhabitants, with few exceptions, were till then
inimical to Europeans, and mostly tainted by
piracy. But he argued truly that these people
knew very imperfectly what Englishmen were,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</span>
and he determined to show them that some, at
all events, were worthy of their confidence, and
could devote themselves without reserve to their
welfare.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of the Rajah’s system was to
treat the natives, as far as possible, as equals;
not only equals before the law, but in society.
All his followers endeavoured to imitate their
chief, and succeeded in a greater or less degree,
thus producing a state of good feeling in the
country which was probably found nowhere else
in the East, except in Perak, one of the Protected
States in the Malay Peninsula, into which one
of his most able assistants introduced his method
of government. I am told that this good feeling,
if not the old friendly intimacy between
native and European, still exists to a considerable
degree throughout the possessions of the
present Rajah, which is highly honourable to
him and to his officers.</p>

<p>I have not attempted to re-write my account
of the Chinese Insurrection (see Chapter VI.).
I wrote it when all the events were fresh
in my mind, and no subsequent information
has rendered it necessary to make any changes.
It was a most interesting and important incident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span>
in the Rajah’s career, and it fixed for
ever in the minds of his countrymen how
wise and beneficent must have been his rule
of the Malays and Dyaks, that they should
have stood by him as they did when
he appeared before them as a defeated
fugitive.</p>

<p>How far-seeing were the Rajah’s views and
plans is proved by the fact that his successor
has found it unnecessary to change any phase
of his policy, whether political or commercial,
whether financial, agricultural or judicial; with
the growth of the country in population and
wealth all has been of course considerably augmented,
but the lines on which this great
advance has been made were laid by the first
Rajah, and that this honour is due to him
no one should deny.</p>

<p>As there was but one Nelson, so there has
been but one Sir James Brooke. How admirable
was the simplicity of his character! So kind
and gentle was he in manner, that the poorest,
most down-trodden native would approach him
without fear, confident that his story would be
heard with benevolent attention, and that any
wrong would, if possible, be righted. And as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</span>
for the purity of his private life, he was a
bright example to all those around him.</p>

<p>It may be thought that I have exaggerated
the grandeur of the Rajah’s personality, and the
great benefits he conferred on the natives, and
that I have been influenced in my views by
the warm friendship which existed between
us. If there be any who hold this opinion, I
would refer them to Mr Alfred Wallace’s
work, <cite>The Malay Archipelago</cite>, in which, after
dwelling in a most appreciative manner on
the Rajah’s rule in Sarawak, he adds these
eloquent words, ‘Since these lines were
written his noble spirit has passed away. But
though by those who knew him not he may
be sneered at as an enthusiastic adventurer, or
abused as a hard-hearted despot, the universal
testimony of everyone who came in contact
with him in his adopted country, whether
European, Malay or Dyak, will be that Rajah
Brooke was a great, a wise and a good ruler,
a true and faithful friend, a man to be admired
for his talents, respected for his honesty and
courage, and loved for his genuine hospitality,
his kindness of disposition and his tenderness
of heart.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</span></p>

<p>The portrait of Rajah Brooke facing the
title page is taken from the picture by Sir
Francis Grant, which is one of his best
works. It is a most speaking likeness, and
I have left it in my will to the Trustees of
the National Portrait Gallery, if they will
accept it.</p>

<p><em>Note.</em>—I would wish to add a few words to explain
why, in the course of this <em>Life</em> of Rajah Brooke, I
have not dwelt on the controversy which raged for
some years about the character of the Seribas and
Sakarang Dyaks. The only person who, to a late
period, held to his view that these tribes were not
piratical was Mr Gladstone; but after reading my
first <em>Life of Rajah Brooke</em>, in which I defended the
policy of my old chief with all the vigour I could
command, I received the following note from him,
which rendered unnecessary any further discussion
of the subject:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right fs80">
<em>February 25, 1880.</em><br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,—I thank you very much for sending
me your <em>Life of Sir James Brooke</em>, which I shall be
anxious to examine with care. I have myself written
words about Sir James Brooke which may serve to show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</span>
that the difference between us is not so wide as might
be supposed, and I fully admit that what I have questioned
in his acts has been accepted by his legitimate superiors,
the Government and the Parliament.—I remain, yours
faithfully,</p>

<span class="smcap">W. E. Gladstone</span>.<br>
</p>

<p class="no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">His Excellency Spenser St John.</span></p>
</div>
<br>

<p>It is as well that I should publish another letter,
to show that Mr Gladstone bore me no ill-will on
account of the vigorous way I had attacked him
whilst defending the policy of my old chief. I had
applied to Lord Granville to be sent out as Special
Envoy to renew relations with the Republic of Mexico,
and the following is his Lordship’s reply:—</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Foreign Office</span>, <em>May 28, 1883</em>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir Spenser</span>,—Many thanks for your note.
I have availed myself of your offer, mentioning it to
Gladstone, who highly approved (notwithstanding the hard
blows you once dealt him), and I have submitted your name
to the Queen, who, I feel sure, will sanction the step.—Yours
sincerely,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Granville</span>.<br>
</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>It is pleasant to place on record this generosity of
feeling in one of our greatest statesmen, whose career
has now been closed.</p>

<p class="no-indent">James Brooke was the second son of Mr Thomas
Brooke of the Honourable East India Company’s
Bengal Civil Service, and of Anna Maria Stuart,
his wife. Their family consisted of two sons and
four daughters. One of the latter, Emma, married
the Rev. F. C. Johnson, Vicar of White Lackington;
another, Margaret, married the Rev. Anthony
Savage; the eldest son, Henry, died unmarried after
a short career in the Indian army.</p>

<p>Mr Thomas Brooke was the seventh in descent
from Sir Thomas Vyner, who, as Lord Mayor of
London, entertained Oliver Cromwell in the Guildhall
in 1654; whilst his only son, Sir Robert Vyner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
who had taken the opposite side in those civil contests,
received Charles II. in the city six years
later. On the death of Sir Robert’s only son
George the baronetcy became extinct, and the
family estate of Eastbury, in Essex, reverted to
the two daughters of Sir Thomas Vyner, from one
of whom, Edith, the Brooke family is derived, as
one of her descendants married a Captain Brooke,
who was Rajah Brooke’s great-grandfather.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Mr Thomas Brooke, though not distinguished
by remarkable talent, was a straightforward, honest
civilian, and his wife was a most lovable woman,
who gained the affections of all those with whom
she was brought into contact. She always enjoyed
the most perfect confidence of her distinguished
son. To her are addressed some of his finest
letters, in which he pours forth his generous ideas
for the promotion of the welfare of the people
whom he had been called upon to govern.</p>

<p>James Brooke was born on the 29th of April
1803 at Secrore, the European suburb of Benares,
and he remained in India until he was twelve
years old, when he was sent to England to the
care of Mrs Brooke, his paternal grandmother, who
had established herself in Reigate. He shortly afterwards
went to Norwich Grammar School, at that
time under Dr Valpy, but he remained there only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
a couple of years, as, after the freedom of his life
in India, discipline was irksome to him, and he ran
away home to his grandmother. I never heard him
say much about the master, but he loved and was
beloved by many of his schoolfellows, and showed
even then, by his influence over the boys, that he
was a born leader of men.</p>

<p>About this time his parents returned from India
and settled at Combe Grove, near Bath, where
they collected their children around them. A
private tutor was engaged to educate young Brooke,
but it could have been only for a comparatively
short time, as in 1819 he received his ensign’s
commission in the 6th Madras Native Infantry, and
soon started for India. He was promoted to his
lieutenancy in 1821, and in the following year
was made a Sub-Assistant Commissary-General, a
post for which, as he used to say, he was eminently
unfitted.</p>

<p>When the war with Burmah broke out in 1824
Brooke found himself thoroughly in his element.
As the English army advanced into Assam the
general in command found himself much hampered
in his movements by the want of cavalry. Brooke
partly relieved him of this difficulty; his offer to
raise a body of horsemen was accepted. By the
orders of the general he called for recruits, who could
ride, from the different regiments, and soon had
under him an efficient body of men, who undertook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
scouting duties. He found it difficult to keep
them in hand, for the moment they saw an enemy
they would charge, and then scatter in every
direction where they thought a Burmese might be
concealed.</p>

<p>During an action in January 1825 he performed
very efficient service with his irregular cavalry,
charging wherever any body of Burmese collected.
He received the thanks of the general, and his
conduct was mentioned in despatches as ‘most
conspicuous.’ Two days later occurred an instance
of what is almost unknown in our army. A company
of native troops had been ordered to attack a
stockade manned by Burmese; the English officer
in command advanced until, on turning a clump of
trees, he came well under fire; then, losing his
nerve, he bolted into the jungle. Brooke arrived
at that moment, saw the infantry wavering, threw
himself from his horse, assumed the command, and
thus encouraged they charged the stockade, but
Brooke literally ‘foremost, fighting fell.’ Seeing their
leader fall, the men were again about to retreat,
when Colonel Richards, advancing with reinforcements,
restored the fight, and in a few minutes
the place was taken, though with heavy loss. No
attempts were ever made to turn these strong
stockades, and thus the army suffered severely and
to no purpose.</p>

<p>I have often heard Sir James Brooke tell the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
story. He had been sent out to reconnoitre;
found the enemy strongly posted, and suspecting
an ambuscade, galloped back to warn his superior
officer, but too late, as firing had already commenced,
and the infantry, without a leader, were
confused. He placed himself at their head, but as
he charged he felt a thud, and fell, losing all consciousness.
After the action was over, his colonel,
who had seen him fall, inquired about young
Brooke, and was told that he was dead; but
examining the fallen officer himself, found him
still alive and had him removed to hospital. A
slug had lodged in his lungs, and for months he
lay between life and death. It was not, in fact,
until August that he was strong enough to be
removed, and then only in a canoe. He was
paddled down a branch of the Bramapootra, rarely
suffering from pain, but gazing pensively at the
fast-running stream and the fine jungle that lined
its banks; in after life it seemed to him as a dream.</p>

<p>On the Medical Board at Calcutta reporting that
a change of climate was necessary, he was given a
long furlough. He returned to England and joined
his family at Bath. The voyage did him some good,
but the wound continued very troublesome, and
at times it appeared as if he could not recover.
After the slug had been extracted, however, he
gradually got better, so that in July 1829 he was
enabled to embark on board the Company’s ship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
<em>Carn Brae</em>; but fate was against his again joining
the Indian army. This vessel was wrecked, and
when, in the following March, he sailed for the
East on board the <em>Huntley Castle</em>, she was so
delayed by bad weather, that when she called in
at Madras Brooke found that he could not join
his regiment before the legal expiration of his
leave. He consequently resigned the service and
proceeded in the <em>Huntley Castle</em> to China.</p>

<p>Brooke never cared much for the East India
Company’s service, and as he had formed friendships
on board the <em>Huntley Castle</em> he preferred continuing in
her to remaining idle in India awaiting the Directors’
decision, which, even if favourable, could scarcely arrive
before twelve months had expired. The decision was
favourable; but as young Brooke had in the meantime
left Madras the matter dropped. The Indiaman first
touched at the Island of Penang, one of the Straits
Settlements, and here Brooke had an opportunity of
seeing what lovely islands there were in the Further
East. It is not necessary to dwell on this voyage, as
nothing of importance occurred during it; but his stay
in China made a deep impression on Brooke’s mind.
He saw how the Chinese ill-treated and bullied our
countrymen, and how the East India Company submitted
to every insult in order not to imperil their trade.</p>

<p>After the usual stay in the Canton River, the
<em>Huntley Castle</em> returned to England, and Brooke
found himself at home with no employment whatever.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
He formed many projects; the favourite one, which
he had discussed with the officers of the <em>Huntley Castle</em>,
was to purchase a ship, load her with suitable goods,
and sail for China or the adjacent markets. But as
none of the friends had any capital, Brooke confided
their views to his father, and naturally met with the
objection that his son was not a trader and never
could become one. However, in the end, the young
fellow prevailed. The brig <em>Findlay</em> was bought, laden
with goods, and with his partner, Kennedy, formerly of
the <em>Huntley Castle</em>, and his friend, Harry Wright, also of
the same vessel, he set sail for the Further East. This
voyage was not destined to be a success. Brooke
wished to introduce on board the easy discipline of a
yacht, whilst Kennedy, who was captain, went to
the other extreme and would insist upon the severe
discipline of the navy, without its safeguards. Differences
soon arose, and as they found trade by interlopers
was not encouraged, Brooke went to see Mr Jardine, of
the firm of Messrs Jardine, Matheson &amp; Company, and
laid the case before him. The shrewd man of business
could not but smile at the idea of this elegant young
soldier managing a trading speculation. He, however,
agreed to buy vessel and cargo, and told the partners
they had better leave the matter in his hands. No
objection was raised, and Mr Jardine so judiciously
invested in silks the amount he had arranged to pay,
that in the end comparatively little loss accrued, none
of which was allowed by Brooke to fall on Kennedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>On his return to England Brooke wearied of
continued leisure, and although he yachted about the
Southern Coast and the Channel Islands, he longed
for some sphere of action which could bring his great
abilities into play. The death of his father, in
December 1835, gave him complete independence.
The fortune left was sufficient to provide for his
wife, and to give to each of his children £30,000.
Brooke now decided to carry out the plan he had
formed since his first voyage to China, which was to
buy a small vessel and start on a voyage of discovery.
But this time there were to be no partners and no
trade; he intended to be complete master in his own
ship. He ultimately fixed his choice on the <em>Royalist</em>,
a schooner yacht of about 142 tons burden. He was
delighted with his purchase, and soon tried her
qualifications by starting in the autumn of 1836 for
a cruise in the Mediterranean. There he visited
most of the principal cities, including Constantinople,
which in after years afforded him a constant subject of
conversation with the Malays, who interested themselves
in every detail of his visit. ‘Roum’ to them is
still the great city where dwells the head of the
Mohammedan religion.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Among those who accompanied
him on this cruise was his nephew, John Brooke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
Johnson, afterwards known as Captain Brooke, and also
John Templer, who was then and for many years afterwards
one of his warm friends and enthusiastic admirers.</p>

<p>Though determined to make a voyage of discovery
in the Eastern Archipelago, Brooke was not able to
leave England till December 1838. He employed all
his spare time in studying the subject, finding out
what was already known, and drawing attention to
his plans by a memoir he wrote on Borneo and
the neighbouring islands, summaries of which were
published in the <cite>Athenæum</cite> and in the <cite>Journal</cite> of the
Geographical Society. He felt a great admiration for
Sir Stamford Raffles, and ardently desired to carry out his
views in dealing with the peoples of the Further East.</p>

<p>How well Brooke sums up the feelings which
prompted him to undertake what was in every respect
a perilous enterprise! ‘Could I carry my vessel to
places where the keel of European ship never before
ploughed the waters; could I plant my foot where
white man’s foot had never before been; could I gaze
upon scenes which educated eyes had never looked on,
see man in the rudest state of nature, I should be
content without looking to further rewards.’</p>

<p>It is difficult, even under the most favourable
circumstances, to convey to the mind of a reader an
exact portrait of the man whose deeds you desire to
chronicle; but as I lived for nearly twenty years with
James Brooke, I feel I know him well in all his
strength and his weakness. Let me try to describe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
him. He stood about five feet ten inches in height;
he had an open, handsome countenance; an active,
supple frame; a daring courage that no danger could
daunt; a sweet, affectionate disposition which endeared
him to all who knew him well. Those whom he
attended in sickness could never forget his almost
womanly tenderness, and those who attended him, his
courageous endurance. His power of attaching both
friends and followers was unrivalled, and this extended
to nearly every native with whom he came in contact.
His few failings were his too great frankness, his
readiness to believe that men were what they professed
to be, or should have been, and (for a short time in
latter years) that the unsophisticated lower classes
were more to be trusted and relied on than those
above them in birth and education. His only weaknesses
were, in truth, such as arose from his great
goodness of heart and his confiding nature.</p>

<p>No painter ever succeeded better in conveying a
man’s self into a portrait than Sir Francis Grant in
his picture of Sir James Brooke. I have it now before
me, and all I have said of his appearance may be seen
at a glance. Although thirty years have passed since
we lost him, he remains as much enshrined as ever in
the hearts of his few surviving friends.</p>

<p>This brief preliminary chapter ended, I will now
describe Brooke’s voyage to Borneo, and the events
which succeeded that remarkable undertaking.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Brooke sailed from Devonport on December 16,
1838, in the <em>Royalist</em>, belonging to the Royal Yacht
Squadron, which, in foreign ports, admitted her to the
same privileges as a ship of war, and enabled her to carry
a white ensign. As the <em>Royalist</em> is still an historic
character in the Eastern Archipelago, I must let the
owner describe her as she was in 1838. ‘She sails
fast; is conveniently fitted up; is armed with six
six-pounders, and a number of swords and small arms
of all sorts; carries four boats and provisions for four
months. Her principal defect is being too sharp in
the floor. She is a good sea boat, and as well calculated
for the service as could be desired. Most of the
hands have been with me for three years, and the
rest are highly recommended.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>Whilst the <em>Royalist</em> is speeding on prosperously
towards Singapore, and calling at Rio Janeiro and
the Cape, let me sum up in a few words the object
of the voyage.</p>

<p>The memorandum<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which Brooke drew up on the
then state of the Indian Archipelago (1838), shows
how carefully he had studied the whole subject. He
first expounds the policy which England should
follow if she wished to recover the position which
she wantonly threw away after the peace of 1815;
he then explains what he proposed to do for the
furtherance of our knowledge of Borneo and the
other great islands to the East. Circumstances,
however, as he anticipated might be the case, made
him change the direction of his first local voyage.</p>

<p>The <em>Royalist</em> arrived in Singapore in May 1839,
and remained at that port till the end of July, refitting
and preparing for future work. There Brooke received
news which induced him to give up for the
present the proposed voyage to Marudu Bay, the
northernmost district of Borneo, and visit Sarawak
instead. Rajah Muda Hassim, uncle to the Sultan
of Brunei, was then residing there, and being of a
kindly disposition, had taken care of the crew of a
shipwrecked English vessel, and sent the men in
safety to Singapore. This unlooked-for conduct on
the part of a Malay chief roused the interest of the
Singapore merchants, and Brooke was requested to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
call in at Sarawak and deliver to the Malay prince a
letter and presents from the Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>This was a fortunate diversion of his voyage, as
at that time Marudu was governed by a notorious
pirate chief. The bay was a rendezvous for some of
the most daring marauders in the Archipelago, and
nothing could have been done there to further our
knowledge of the interior.</p>

<p>All being ready, and the crew strengthened by
eight Singapore Malay seamen,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> athletic fellows, capital
at the oar, and to save the white men the work of
wooding and watering, the <em>Royalist</em> sailed for Borneo
on the 27th of July, and in five days was anchored
off the coast of Sambas. All the charts were found
to be wrong, so that every care had to be taken
whilst working up the coast. A running survey
was made, and on the 11th August Brooke found
himself at the mouth of the Sarawak river.</p>

<p>When Brooke first arrived in Borneo, the Sultan
Omar Ali claimed all the coast from the capital to
Tanjong Datu, whilst further south was Sambas,
under the influence of the Dutch; but the rule of
Omar Ali was little more than nominal, as each chief
in the different districts exercised almost unlimited
power, and paid little or no tribute to the central
Government.</p>

<p>At the time of Brooke’s first visit to Sarawak the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
Malays of the country had broken out into revolt against
the oppressive rule of Pangeran Makota, Governor of
the district, and fearing that they might call in the aid of
the Sambas Malays, and thus place the country under
the control of the Dutch, the Sultan sent down
Rajah Muda Hassim, his uncle and heir-presumptive,
to endeavour to stifle the rebellion; but three years
had passed, and he had done nothing. He could
prevent the rebels from communicating with the sea,
but he was powerless in the interior.</p>

<p>On hearing of the arrival of the <em>Royalist</em> at the
mouth of the river, Muda Hassim despatched a deputation
to welcome the stranger and invite him to the
capital—rather a grand name for a small village.
Brooke soon got his vessel under weigh, and proceeded
up the Sarawak, and after one slight mishap, anchored
the next day opposite the rajah’s house, and saluted
his flag with twenty-one guns.</p>

<p>Muda Hassim received Brooke in state, and the
interview is thus described: ‘The rajah was seated
in his hall of audience, which, outside, is nothing but
a large shed, erected on piles, but within decorated
with taste. Chairs were arranged on either side of
the ruler, who occupied the head seat. Our party
were placed on one hand, and on the other sat his
brother Mahommed, and Makota and some other of
the principal chiefs, whilst immediately behind him
his twelve younger brothers were seated. The dress
of Muda Hassim was simple, but of rich material, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
most of the principal men were well, and even superbly
dressed. His countenance is plain, but intelligent and
highly pleasing, and his manners perfectly easy. His
reception was kind, and, I am given to understand,
highly flattering. We sat, however, trammelled by
the formalities of state, and our conversation did not
extend beyond kind inquiries and professions of friendship.’
Brooke’s next interview was more informal,
and closer relations were established, which encouraged
him to send his interpreter, Mr Williamson, to ask
permission to visit the Dyaks. This was readily
granted, but before commencing his explorations,
he received a private visit from Pangeran Makota.
He was probably the most intelligent Malay whom
we ever met in Borneo, frank and open in manner,
but looked upon as the most cunning of the rajah’s
advisers. He was much puzzled, as were indeed all
the nobles, as to the true object of Brooke’s visit to
Borneo, and confident in his power, determined to
find it out. And though Brooke had in reality no
object but geographical discovery, he could not convince
his guest of that fact, who scented some deep
intrigue under the guise of a harmless visit.</p>

<p>Brooke now took advantage of the rajah’s permission
to explore some of the neighbouring rivers, and he was
shown first the fine agricultural district of Samarahan,
but only met Malays. His next visit was to the
Dyak tribe of Sibuyows, who lived on the river
Lundu, which discharged its waters not many miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
from Cape Datu, the southern boundary of Borneo
proper.</p>

<p>From Tanjong Datu, as far as the river Rejang,
the interior populations are called Dyaks—Land or
Sea Dyaks—the former, a quiet, agricultural people,
living in the far interior, plundered and oppressed by
the Malays; they are to be found in Sarawak, Samarahan
and Sadong. The Sea Dyaks were much more
numerous, and though under the influence of the
Malays and Arab adventurers, were too powerful ever
to be ill-treated. They occupied the districts of Seribas
and Batang Lupar, and those on the left bank of the
Rejang, with a few scattered villages in other parts,
such as this Sibuyow tribe on the Lundu.</p>

<p>The chief of this branch of the Sea Dyaks, the
Orang Kaya Tumangong, was always a great
favourite of the English officers in Sarawak. His
was the first tribe that Brooke visited, and he then
formed a high opinion of the brave man and his
gallant sons, who were faithful unto death, and who
were always the foremost when any fighting was on
hand.</p>

<p>The village they occupied was, in fact, but one huge
house, nearly six hundred feet in length, and the inner
half divided into fifty separate residences for the fifty
families that constituted the tribe. The front half of
this long building was an open space, which was used
by the inhabitants during the day for every species of
work, and at night was occupied by the widowers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
bachelors and boys as their bedroom. The Sea
Dyaks are much cleaner than the Land Dyaks, and
the girls of Sakarang, for instance, looked as well
washed as any of their sisters in May Fair.</p>

<p>The distinction of Land and Sea Dyaks was due
to the fact that the former never ventured near the
salt water, whilst the latter boldly pushed out to sea
in their light bangkongs or war boats, and cruised
along at least two thousand miles of coast. When the
<em>Royalist</em> first arrived in Sarawak the majority of the
Sea Dyaks were piratically inclined. This practice
arose in all probability from their inter-tribal wars—the
Seribas against the Lingas and Sibuyows—and from
their custom of seeking heads—almost a religious
observance. When a party of young men went out to
search for the means of marrying, and had failed to
secure the heads of enemies, we can easily imagine
their not being too particular about killing any weaker
party they might meet, even if they were not enemies,
and, finding it met with no retaliation, continuing the
practice. In this they were encouraged by the Malay
chiefs who lived among them, and who obtained, on
easy terms, the women and children captives who fell
into the hands of the Dyak raiders. Although the
Linga and Sibuyow branches of the Sea Dyaks hunted
for heads, they were the heads of their enemies, whilst
the Seribas, and, in a lesser degree, the Sea Dyaks of
the Sakarang and the Rejang spared no one they
could overcome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>Brooke’s next visit was to the river Sadong, to the
north-east of Sarawak, and there he met Sherif Sahib,
a great encourager of piracy of every kind. Sometimes
he received the Lanuns,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the boldest marauders
who ever invested the Far Eastern seas, bought their
captives and supplied them with food, whilst at others
he would aid the Seribas and Sakarangs in their forays
on the almost defenceless tribes of the interior, or
share their plunder acquired on the coasts of the
Dutch possessions.</p>

<p>Finding that the rebellion in the interior of the
Sarawak would prevent him from visiting it,
Brooke decided to return to Singapore. After a
friendly parting with Muda Hassim, whose last
words were, ‘Do not forget me,’ the <em>Royalist</em> fell
down the river. The night before Brooke had
settled to sail he was joined by a small Sarawak
boat with a dozen men, who were to pilot him out;
but about midnight shouts were heard from the shore
of ‘Dyak! Dyak’! In an instant a blue light was
burnt on board the yacht and a gun fired, and then
there came a dead silence. Brooke sprang into a
boat and pushed off to the Malay prahu, to find
half the crew wounded. It seemed that a cruising
party of Seribas Dyaks had no doubt seen the fire
lighted on the shore, and had noiselessly floated up
with the flood tide and attacked the Malays, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
observing in the dark night the <em>Royalist</em> at anchor.
This occurrence showed how necessary it was to be
on one’s guard at all times.</p>

<p>The news brought by Brooke was well received in
Singapore, as it opened up a new country to British
commerce, and prevented the Dutch gaining a footing
there, with their vexatious trade regulations,
which practically debarred native vessels from visiting
British ports.</p>

<p>As the Rajah Muda Hassim had assured his English
visitor that the rebellion in the interior of Sarawak
would collapse before the next fine season, he decided
to pass the interval in visiting Celebes, a most attractive
island, then but imperfectly known.</p>

<p>No part of Brooke’s journals is more interesting
than the account of his experiences in Bugis land.
They are, however, simple travels, without many
personal incidents to be noted; but here, as elsewhere,
he acquired the same ascendency over the natives,
and the memory of his visit remained impressed on
the minds of the Bugis rulers, who followed his
advice in regulating their kingdoms, and especially
listened to his counsels when he pointed out the
danger of entering into armed conflict with their
Dutch neighbours.</p>

<p>The following observations extracted from Brooke’s
journals are remarkable: ‘I must mention the
effect of European domination in the Archipelago.
The first voyagers from the West found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
the natives rich and powerful, with strong established
governments and a thriving trade. The
rapacious European has reduced them to their
present position. Their governments have been
broken up, the old states decomposed by treachery,
bribery and intrigue, their possessions snatched from
them under flimsy pretences, their trade restricted,
their vices encouraged, their virtues repressed, and
their energies paralysed or rendered desperate, till
there is every reason to fear the gradual extinction
of the Malay. Let these considerations, fairly reflected
on and enlarged, be presented to the candid
and liberal mind, and I think that, however strong
the present prepossessions, they will shake the belief
in the advantages to be gained by European ascendency,
as it has heretofore been conducted, and will
convince the most sceptical of the miseries immediately
and prospectively flowing from European rule
as generally constituted.’</p>

<p>The above observations naturally apply to the
Dutch and Spanish systems, which at that time
alone had sway in the Archipelago, as England,
with its small trading depots, did not actively interfere
with the native princes. Yet it must be confessed
that Borneo proper, which had generally escaped
interference from their European neighbours, fell from
a position fairly important to the most degraded state,
entirely owing to the incapacity of its native rulers
and not to outside influences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>The visits to Sarawak and Celebes tended to confirm
Brooke’s convictions that, if England would
but act on a settled plan and on a sufficient scale,
she could still save and develop the independent
native states, without any necessity of occupying
them.</p>

<p>In the year 1776 the Sultan of Sulu ceded to
England all his possessions in the north of Borneo,
and the East India Company formed a small settlement
on the Island of Balambangan; this being
on a very inefficient scale, was easily surprised by
pirates and destroyed. Later on another attempt was
made by the Company to establish themselves on
the island, but it was soon abandoned.</p>

<p>Brooke, after carefully studying the subject, came to
the same conclusion as Sir Stamford Raffles and Colonel
Farquhar had done before him, that it was a mistake
to take small islands; but that, on the contrary, this
country should establish a settlement on the mainland
of Borneo. As all the independent states of the Archipelago
are filled with a maritime population, islands
are not so safe from attack as the mainland, where
the interior population is rarely warlike. He recommended
that England should take possession of
Marudu Bay, establish herself strongly there, be
constantly supported by the navy, and from thence
the Governor, with diplomatic powers, could visit
all the independent chiefs and make such treaties
with them as would prevent their being absorbed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
other European States. His policy was of the most
liberal kind; he would have sought no exclusive trade
privileges, but he would have preserved their political
independence. He would have established in the
more important states carefully-selected English
agents, to encourage the chiefs in useful reforms
and to prevent restrictions on commerce. On the
mainland he would not have instantly established
English rule, except in a well-chosen, central spot,
and there he would have awaited the invitation of
the chiefs to send an English officer to aid them in
governing.</p>

<p>Had this great plan been executed on a suitable
scale Brooke’s name would have been enshrined
among the greatest builders of the British Empire.
It is not too late even now; but where shall we
find another Brooke to carry it out? North Borneo
is at present under the protection of Great Britain,
but it is owned and administered by a Chartered
Company, and in these days cannot, under such
conditions, hold the same position as a Crown
colony.</p>

<p>The time seems propitious. The Spaniards have
lost their hold over the Philippines, and Sulu and the
great island of Mindanau will soon be free from their
depressing influence; even the Dutch are acting on
a more enlightened system, which would be encouraged,
if England took an active interest in the
Archipelago. The North Borneo Company would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
scarcely refuse a proposal to place the country under
our direct rule, and with another Sir Hugh Low
it might be made a valuable possession, and would
gradually dominate the whole of the Archipelago.</p>

<p>The Philippines will now be governed by one of
the most progressive nations in the world, and the
effect of their rule will be far-reaching. It would
appear to be advisable that Great Britain should
simultaneously take over North Borneo, as the conditions
heretofore existing have so completely changed.</p>

<p>From Celebes Brooke returned to Singapore to
refit. His plans were to visit Borneo again, then
proceed to Manila, and so home by Cape Horn. He
arrived at our settlement in May, left it again in
August, and reached Sarawak on the 29th, to find
himself cordially received by Muda Hassim. The
war was not over, nor was the end of it in sight.
A few half-starved Dyaks had deserted the Sarawak
Malays, and come into the Bornean camp to be fed;
but the route to Sambas was still open, and it was
suspected that supplies were furnished by the Sultan
of Sambas, who coveted the territory.</p>

<p>After considerable discussion and consideration,
Brooke thought he would visit the headquarters of
the army which was supposed to be besieging the
enemy; but he found it seven miles below the
principal hostile fort. The spot was called Ledah
Tanah, or the tongue of land, where the two
branches of the river meet. It was the site of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
old capital, and even when I was there some ten
years later the iron-wood posts of the houses still
existed, untouched by time, though over sixty years
in use. As Brooke expected, Makota, at the head
of the army, was doing nothing, and as he rejected
the advice of his white visitor, and seemed determined
not to advance nearer to the enemy, Brooke returned
to Sarawak, and even announced his departure, as
the North-East monsoon was coming on, and he did
not wish to face it on his voyage to Manila. However,
Muda Hassim appeared to feel his departure so
acutely, that his heart smote him, and he agreed to
visit the army once more, particularly as the Land
Dyaks were now really leaving the rebels and joining
the Bornean forces. He therefore returned to the
camp, and by his energy compelled Makota to act.
The stockade at Ledah Tanah was pulled down and
moved to within a mile of the enemy’s chief fort,
Balidah, and gradually stockade after stockade was
built, until the most commanding one was erected
within three hundred yards of the hostile fort. Brooke
sent to the yacht for two six-pounders and a sufficient
supply of ammunition, and, with the aid of his men,
soon battered down the weak defences of the enemy,
and then proposed an assault. But this bold advice
was looked upon as insanity, and though promises to
advance were freely given, when it came to action
they all hung back. At length, wearied with this procrastination,
Brooke, in spite of the entreaties of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
the native chiefs, embarked his guns and returned to
the <em>Royalist</em>, and sent word to the rajah that his
stay was utterly useless; but when Muda Hassim
heard the decision, ‘his deep regret was so visible
that even all the self-command of the native could
not disguise it. He begged, he entreated me to
stay, and offered me the country, its government
and its trade, if I would only stop and not desert
him.’</p>

<p>Though Brooke could not accept the grant then,
as it would have been extracted from the rajah’s deep
distress, he agreed to return to the army; and once
more the guns were embarked in the boats, and every
man who could be spared from the <em>Royalist</em> accompanied
Brooke to the front. There he met Budrudin, Muda
Hassim’s favourite brother, with whom he soon contracted
a friendship which ended only with the Malay
prince’s life. He was brave, frank and intelligent;
he quickly appreciated the noble character of the
white leader of men, and ever after he fully trusted
him.</p>

<p>The episodes of the closing campaign of this civil
war were so amusing, that although the story has been
published several times, I cannot refrain from repeating
it again in the words of the English chief.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>‘On the 10th December we reached the fleet and
disembarked our guns, taking up our residence in
a house, or rather shed, close to the water. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
rajah’s brother, Pangeran Budrudin, was with the
army, and I found him ready and willing to urge
upon the other indolent pangerans the proposals I
made for vigorous hostilities. We found the grand
army in a state of torpor, eating, drinking and walking
up to the forts and back again daily; but having built
these imposing structures, and their appearance not
driving the enemy away, they were at a loss what
to do next, or how to proceed. On my arrival, I
once more insisted on mounting the guns in our
old forts, and assaulting Balidah under their fire.
Makota’s timidity and vacillation were too apparent;
but in consequence of Budrudin’s overawing presence
he was obliged, from shame, to yield his assent. The
order for the attack was fixed as follows: our party
of ten (leaving six to serve the guns) were to be
headed by myself. Budrudin, Makota, Subtu and
all the lesser chiefs were to lead their followers,
from sixty to eighty in number, by the same route,
whilst fifty or more Chinese, under their captain, were
to assault by another path to their left. Makota was
to make the paths as near as possible to Balidah, with
his Dyaks, who were to extract the sudas and fill up
the holes. The guns having been mounted, and their
range ascertained the previous evening, we ascended
to the fort about eight a.m., and at ten opened our fire
and kept it up for an hour. The effect was severe.
Every shot told upon their thin defences of wood,
which fell in many places so as to leave storming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
breaches. Part of the roof was cut away and tumbled
down, and the shower of grape and canister rattled so
as to prevent their returning our fire, except from
a stray rifle. At mid-day the forces reached the
fort, and it was then discovered that Makota had
neglected to make any road because it rained the
night before! It was evident that the rebels had
gained information of our intentions as they had
erected a fringe of bamboo along their defences on
the very spot we had agreed to mount. Makota
fancied the want of a road would delay the attack;
but I well knew that delay was equivalent to failure,
and so it was at once agreed that we should advance
without any path. The poor man’s cunning and
resources were now nearly at an end. He could not
refuse to accompany us, but his courage could not
be brought to the point, and pale and embarrassed
he retired. Everything was ready—Budrudin, the
Capitan China and myself, at the head of our men—when
he once more appeared, and raised a subtle
point of etiquette, which answered his purpose. He
represented to Budrudin that the Malays were unanimously
of opinion that the rajah’s brother could
not expose himself in an assault; that the dread of
the rajah’s indignation far exceeded their dread of
death; and in case any accident happened to him,
his brother’s fury would fall on them. Budrudin
was angry, I was angry too, and the doctor most
angry of all; but anger was unavailing. It was clear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
they did not intend to do anything in earnest; and
after much discussion, in which Budrudin insisted if
I went he should likewise go, and the Malays insisted
that if he went they would not go, it was resolved
that we should serve the guns, whilst Abong Mia
and the Chinese, not under the captain, should
proceed to the assault. But its fate was sealed, and
Makota had gained his object; for neither he nor
Subtu thought of exposing themselves to a single
shot. Our artillery opened and was beautifully
served. The hostile forces attempted to advance, but
our fire completely subdued them, as only three rifles
answered us, by one of which a seaman was wounded
in the hand, but not seriously. Two-thirds of the way
the storming party proceeded without the hostile army
being aware of their advance, and they might have
reached the very foot of the hill without being discovered,
had not Abong Mia, from excess of piety
and rashness, began most loudly to say his prayers.
The three rifles began then to play on them. One
Chinaman was killed, the whole halted, the prayers
were more vehement than ever, and after squatting
under cover of the jungle for some time they all
returned. It was only what I expected, but I was
greatly annoyed by their cowardice and treachery—treachery
to their own cause. One lesson, however,
I learnt, and that was, that had I assaulted with our
small party, we should assuredly have been victimised.
The very evening of the failure the rajah came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
up the river. I would not see him, and only heard
that the chiefs got severely reprimanded; but the
effects of reprimand are lost where cowardice is
stronger than shame. Inactivity followed, two or
three useless forts were built, and Budrudin, much
to my regret and to the detriment of the cause,
was recalled.</p>

<p>‘Amongst the straggling arrivals I may mention
Pangeran Dallam, with a number of men, consisting
of the Orang Bintulu, Meri, Muka and Kayan Dyaks
from the interior. Our house, or, as it originally stood,
our shed, deserves a brief record. It was about twenty
feet long, with a loose floor of reeds and an attap or
palm-leaf roof. It served us for some time, but the
attempts at theft obliged us to fence it in and
divide it into apartments—one at the end served for
Middleton, Williamson and myself. Adjoining it was
the storeroom and hospital, and the other extreme
belonged to the seamen. Our improvements kept
pace with our necessities. Theft induced us to shut
in our house at the sides, and the unevenness of the
reeds suggested the advantage of laying a floor of the
bark of trees over them, which, with mats over all,
rendered our domicile far from uncomfortable. Our
forts gradually extended to the back of the enemy’s
town, on a ridge of swelling ground, whilst they
kept pace with us on the same side of the river on
the low ground. The inactivity of our troops had
long become a by-word amongst us. It was, indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
truly vexatious, but it was in vain to urge them
on, in vain to offer assistance, in vain to propose
a joint attack, or even to seek support at their hands;
promises were to be had in plenty, but performances
never.</p>

<p>‘At length our leaders resolved on building a fort
at Sekundis, thus outflanking the enemy and gaining
the command of the upper course of the river.
The post was certainly an important one, and in
consequence they set about it with the happy indifference
which characterises their proceedings.
Pangeran Illudin (the most active amongst them)
had the building of the fort, assisted by the Orang
Kaya Tumangong of Lundu. Makota, Subtu and
others were at the next fort, and by chance I was
there likewise; for it seemed to be little apprehended
that any interruption would take place, as the Chinese
and the greater part of the Malays had been left in
the boats. When the fort commenced, however, the
enemy crossed the river and divided into two bodies,
the one keeping in check the party at Pangeran
Gapoor’s fort, whilst the other made an attack on
the works. The ground was not unfavourable for
their purpose, for Pangeran Gapoor’s fort was
separated from Sekundis by a belt of thick wood
which reached down to the river’s edge. Sekundis
itself, however, stood on clear ground, as did Gapoor’s
fort. I was with Makota at the latter when the
enemy approached through the jungle. The two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
parties were within easy speaking distance, challenging
and threatening each other, but the thickness of
the jungle prevented our seeing or penetrating to
them. When this body had advanced, the real
attack commenced on Sekundis with a fire of
musketry, and I was about to proceed to the scene,
but was detained by Makota, who assured me there
were plenty of men, and that it was nothing at all.
As the musketry became thicker, I had my doubts
when a Dyak came running through the jungle, and
with gestures of impatience and anxiety begged me
to assist the party attacked. He had been sent by
my old friend the Tumangong of Lundu, to say
they could not hold the post unless supported. In
spite of Makota’s remonstrances, I struck into the
jungle, winded through the narrow path, and, after
crossing an ugly stream, emerged on the clear ground.
The sight was a pretty one. To the right was the unfinished
stockade, defended by the Tumangong; to the
left, at the edge of the forest, about twelve or fifteen
of our party, commanded by Illudin, whilst the
enemy were stretched along between the points, and
kept up a sharp-shooting from the hollow ground on
the bank of the river. They fired and loaded and
fired, and had gradually advanced on the stockade,
as the ammunition of our party failed; and as we
emerged from the jungle, they were within twenty
or five-and-twenty yards of the defence. A glance
immediately showed me the advantage of our position,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
and I charged with my Englishmen across the padi
field, and the instant we appeared on the ridge above
the river, in the hollows of which the rebels were
seeking protection, their rout was complete. They
scampered off in every direction, whilst the Dyaks
and Malays pushed them into the river. Our victory
was decisive and bloodless; the scene was changed in
an instant, and the defeated foe lost arms and ammunition
either on the field of battle or in the river, and our
exulting conquerors set no bounds to their triumph.</p>

<p>‘I cannot omit to mention the name of Si Tundu,
a Lanun, the only native who charged with us.
His appearance and dress were most striking, the
latter being entirely of red, bound round the waist,
arms, forehead, etc., with gold ornaments, and in
his hand his formidable Bajuk sword. He danced,
or rather galloped, across the field close to me, and,
mixing with the enemy, was about to despatch a
haji, or priest, who was prostrate before him, when
one of our people interposed, and saved him by
stating that he was a companion of our own. The
Lundu Dyaks were very thankful for our support,
our praises were loudly sung, and the stockade was
concluded. After the rout, Makota, Subtu and Abong
Mia arrived on the field; the last, with forty followers,
had ventured half way before the firing ceased, but
the detachment, under a paltry subterfuge, halted so
as not to be in time. The enemy might have had
fifty men at the attack. The defending party consisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
of about the same number, but the Dyaks
had very few muskets. I had a dozen Englishmen,
Subu, one of our Singapore boatmen, and Si Tundu.
Sekundis was a great point gained, as it hindered the
enemy from ascending the river and seeking supplies.</p>

<p>‘Makota, Subtu and the whole tribe arrived as
soon as their safety from danger allowed, and none
were louder in their own praise, but, nevertheless,
their countenances evinced some sense of shame,
which they endeavoured to disguise by the use of
their tongues. The Chinese came really to afford
assistance, but too late. We remained until the
stockade of Sekundis was finished, while the enemy
kept up a wasteful fire from the opposite side of the
river, which did no harm.</p>

<p>‘The next great object was to follow up the advantage
by crossing the stream, but day after day some
fresh excuse brought on fresh delay, and Makota
built a new fort and made a new road within a
hundred yards of our old position. I cannot detail
further our proceedings for many days, which consisted,
on my part, in efforts to get something done,
and on the others, a close adherence to the old system
of promising everything and doing nothing. The
Chinese, like the Malays, refused to act; but on their
part it was not fear, but disinclination. By degrees,
however, the preparations for the new fort were complete,
and I had gradually gained over a party of the
natives to my views; and, indeed, amongst the Malays,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
the bravest of them had joined themselves to us, and
what was better, we had Datu Pangerang and
thirteen Illanuns, and the Capitan China allowed
me to take his men whenever I wanted them.
My weight and consequence was increased, and
I rarely moved now without a long train of
followers. The next step, whilst crossing the river
was uncertain, was to take my guns up to Gapoor’s
fort, which was about six or seven hundred yards
from the town, and half the distance from a rebel
fort on the river’s bank.</p>

<p>‘Panglima Rajah, the day after our guns were in
battery, took it into his head to build a fort on the
river’s side, close to the town in front, and between
two of the enemy’s forts. It was a bold undertaking
for the old man after six weeks of uninterrupted
repose. At night, the wood being prepared, the
party moved down, and worked so silently that they
were not discovered till their defence was nearly
finished, when the enemy commenced a general firing
from all their forts, returned by a similar firing from
all ours, none of the parties being quite clear what
they were firing at or about, and the hottest from
either party being equally harmless. We were at the
time about going to bed in our habitation, but expecting
some reverse I set off to the stockade where
our guns were placed, and opened a fire upon the
town and the stockade near us, till the enemy’s fire
gradually slackened and died away. We then returned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
and in the morning were greeted with the
pleasing news that they had burned and deserted five
of their forts, and left us sole occupants of the left
bank of the river. The same day, going through the
jungle to see one of these deserted forts, we came
upon a party of the enemy, and had a brief skirmish
with them before they took to flight. Nothing can
be more unpleasant to a European than this bush-fighting,
where he scarce sees a foe, whilst he is well
aware that their eyesight is far superior to his own.
To proceed with this narrative, I may say that four
or five forts were built on the edge of the river
opposite the enemy’s town, and distant not above
fifty or sixty yards. Here our guns were removed, and
a fresh battery formed ready for a bombardment, and
fire-balls essayed to ignite the houses.</p>

<p>‘At this time Sherif Jaffer, from Linga, arrived with
about seventy men, Malays and Dyaks of Balow.
The river Linga, being situated close to Seribas, and
incessant hostilities being waged between the two
places, he and his followers were both more active
and warlike than the Borneans; but their warfare
consists of closing hand to hand with spear and
sword. They scarcely understood the proper use
of firearms, and were of little use in attacking
stockades. As a negotiator, however, the Sherif bore
a distinguished part; and on his arrival a parley
ensued, much against Makota’s will, and some
meetings took place between Jaffer and a brother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
Sherif at Siniawan, named Moksain. After ten days’
delay nothing came of it, though the enemy betrayed
great desire to yield. This negotiation being at an
end, we had a day’s bombardment, and a fresh treaty
brought about thus: Makota being absent in Sarawak,
I received a message from Sherif Jaffer and Pangeran
Subtu to say that they wished to meet me; and on
my consenting they stated that Sherif Jaffer felt
confident the war might be brought to an end,
though alone he dared not treat with the rebels; but,
in case I felt inclined to join him, we could bring it
to a favourable conclusion. I replied that our habits
of treating were very unlike their own, as we allowed
no delays to interpose; but that I would unite with
him for one interview, and if that interview was
favourable we might meet the chiefs at once and
settle it, or put an end to all further treating.
Pangeran Subtu was delighted with the proposition,
urged its great advantages, and the meeting, by my
desire, was fixed for that very night, the place
Pangeran Illudin’s fort at Sekundis. The evening
arrived, and at dark we were at the appointed place
and a message was despatched for Sherif Moksain.
In the meantime, however, came a man from Pangeran
Subtu to beg us to hold no intercourse; that the
rebels were false, meant to deceive us, and if they
did come we had better make them prisoners. Sherif
Jaffer, after arguing the point some time, rose to
depart, remarking that with such proceedings he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
would not consent to treat. I urged him to stay,
but finding him bent on going I ordered my gig
(which had some time before been brought overland)
to be put into the water—my intention being to
proceed to the enemy’s kampong and hear what they
had to say. I added that it was folly to leave undone
what we had agreed to do in the morning because
Pangeran Subtu changed his mind; that I had come
to treat, and treat I would. I would not go away
now without giving the enemy a fair hearing. For
the good of all parties I would do it—and if the
Sherif liked to join me, as we proposed before, and
wait for Sherif Moksain, good; if not, I would go in
the boat to the kampong. My Europeans, on being
ordered, jumped up, ran out and brought the boat
to the water’s edge and in a few minutes oars, rudder
and rowlocks were in her. My companions, seeing
this, came to terms, and we waited for Sherif Moksain,
during which, however, I overheard a whispering
conversation from Subtu’s messenger, proposing to
seize him, and my temper was ruffled to such a
degree, that I drew out a pistol, and told him I would
shoot him dead if he dared to seize, or talk of seizing,
any man who trusted himself from the enemy to meet
me. The scoundrel slunk off, and we were no more
troubled with him. This past, Sherif Moksain arrived,
and was introduced into our fortress alone—alone
and unarmed in an enemy’s stockade, manned with
two hundred men. His bearing was firm; he advanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
with ease and took his seat, and during the
interview the only sign of uneasiness was the quick
glance of his eye from side to side. The object he
aimed at was to gain my guarantee that the lives of
all the rebels should be spared, but this I had not in
my power to grant. He returned to his kampong,
and came again towards morning, when it was agreed
that Sherif Jaffer and myself should meet the Patingis
and the Tumangong, and arrange terms with them.
By the time our conference was over the day broke,
and we descended to our boats to have a little rest.</p>

<p>‘On the 20th December we met the chiefs on the
river, and they expressed themselves ready to yield,
without conditions, to the rajah, if I would promise
that they should not be put to death. My reply
was that I could give no such promise; but if they
surrendered, it must be for life or death, according to
the rajah’s pleasure, and all I could do was to use
my influence to save their lives. To this they
assented after a while; but then there arose the more
difficult question, how they were to be protected
until the rajah’s orders arrived. They dreaded both
Chinese and Malays, especially the former, who had
just cause for angry feelings, and who, it was feared,
would make an attack on them directly their surrender
had taken from them their means of defence.
The Malays would not assail them in a body, but
would individually plunder them, and give occasion
for disputes and bloodshed. Their apprehensions were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
almost sufficient to break off the hitherto favourable
negotiations, had I not proposed to them myself to
undertake their defence, and to become responsible
for their safety until the orders of their sovereign
arrived. On my pledging myself to this they yielded
up their strong fort of Balidah, the key of their
position. I immediately made it known to our own
party that no boats were to ascend or descend the
river, and that any person attacking or pillaging the
rebels were my enemies, and that I should fire upon
them without hesitation.</p>

<p>‘Both Chinese and Malays agreed to the propriety of
the measure, and gave me the strongest assurances of
restraining their respective followers; the former with
good faith, the latter with the intention of involving
matters, if possible, to the destruction of the rebels.
By the evening we were in possession of Balidah, and
certainly found it a formidable fortress, situated on a
steep mound, with dense defences of wood, triple deep,
and surrounded by two enclosures, thickly studded on
the outside with <em>ranjaus</em>. The effect of our fire had
shaken it completely, now much to our discomfort,
for the walls were tottering and the roof as leaky as a
sieve. On the 20th December, then, the war closed.
The very next day, contrary to stipulation, the Malay
pangerans tried to ascend the river, and when stopped
began to expostulate. After preventing many, the
attempt was made by Subtu and Pangeran Hassim
in three large boats, boldly pulling towards us.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
Three hails did not check them, and they came on,
in spite of a blank cartridge and a wide ball to turn
them back. But I was resolved, and when a dozen
musket balls whistled over and fell close around them,
they took to an ignominious flight. I subsequently
upbraided them for this breach of promise, and Makota
loudly declared they had been greatly to blame, but I
discovered that he himself had set them on.</p>

<p>‘I may now briefly conclude these details. I ordered
the rebels to burn all their stockades, which they did
at once, and deliver up the greater part of their arms,
and I proceeded to the rajah to request from him their
lives. Those who know the Malay character will
appreciate the difficulty of the attempt to stand between
the monarch and his victims. I only succeeded
when, at the end of a long debate—I soliciting, he
denying—I rose to bid him farewell, as it was my
intention to sail directly, since, after all my exertions
in his cause he would not grant me the lives of the
people, I could only consider that his friendship for
me was at an end. On this he yielded. I must own
that during the discussion he had much the best of it;
for he urged that they had forfeited their lives by the
law, as a necessary sacrifice to the future peace of the
country; and argued that in a similar case in my own
native land no leniency would be shown. On the
contrary, my reasoning, though personal, was, on the
whole, the best for the rajah and the people. I
explained my extreme reluctance to have the blood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
of conquered foes shed; the shame I should experience
in being a party, however involuntarily, to their execution,
and the general advantage of a merciful line of
policy. At the same time I told him that their lives
were forfeited, their crimes had been of a heinous
and unpardonable nature, and that it was only from so
humane a man as himself, one with so kind a heart,
that I could ask for their pardon; but, I added, he
well knew that it was only my previous knowledge of
his benevolent disposition, and the great friendship I
felt for him, which had induced me to take any part
in the struggle. Other stronger reasons might have
been brought forward, which I forbore to employ,
as being repugnant to his princely pride, viz., that
severity in this case would arm many against him,
raise powerful enemies in Borneo proper, as well as
here, and greatly impede the future right government
of the country. However, having gained my point, I
was satisfied.</p>

<p>‘Having fulfilled this engagement, and being, moreover,
with many of my Europeans, attacked with ague,
I left the scene with all the dignity of complete success.
Subsequently the rebels were ordered to deliver
up all their arms, ammunition and property; and last,
the wives and children of the principal people were
demanded as hostages and obtained. The women and
children were treated with kindness and preserved
from injury or wrong. Siniawan thus dwindled
away. The poorer men stole off in canoes, and were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
scattered about, most of them coming to Kuching.
The better class pulled down the houses, abandoned
the town and lived in boats for a month when,
alarmed by the delay in settling terms and impelled
by hunger, they also fled—Patingi Gapoor, it was said,
to Sambas, and Patingi Ali and the Tumangong
amongst the Dyaks. After a time it was supposed
they would return and receive their wives and
children. The army gradually dispersed to seek
food, and the Chinese were left in possession of the
once renowned Siniawan, the ruin of which they
completed by burning all that remained and erecting
a village for themselves in the immediate neighbourhood.
Sherif Jaffer and many others departed to their
respective homes, and the pinching of famine succeeded
to the horrors of war. Fruit, being in season, helped
to support the wretched people, and the near approach
of the rice harvest kept up their spirits.’</p>

<p>Thus ended the great civil war, which is so renowned
in local history. The three chiefs mentioned—Patingi
Gapoor, Patingi Ali and the Tumangong—with
their sons and relatives, will appear again as some
of the principal actors in the history of Sarawak. All
except Patingi Gapoor remained faithful to the end,
or are still among the main supports of the present
Government. I knew them all, with the exception of
Patingi Ali, who was killed whilst gallantly heading
an attack on the Sakarang pirates during Captain
Keppel’s expedition in 1844.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Peace being again restored to the country, Brooke
was enabled to study the position. Muda Hassim
occasionally mentioned his intention of rewarding his
English ally for his great services by giving him the
government of Sarawak; but nothing came of it, as
when the document for submission to the Sultan was
duly prepared it proved to be nothing but ‘permission
to trade.’ However unsatisfactory this might be,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
Brooke accepted it for the moment, and it was agreed
that he should proceed to Singapore, load a schooner
with merchandise, and return to open up the resources
of the place. In the meantime the rajah was to
build a house for his friend, and prepare a shipload of
antimony ore as a return cargo for the schooner.</p>

<p>While in Singapore Brooke wrote to his mother
concerning his plans, and he now added, ‘I really
have excellent hopes that this effort of mine will succeed;
and while it ameliorates the condition of the
unhappy natives, and tends to the promotion of the
highest philanthropy, it will secure to me some better
means of carrying through these grand objects. I call
them grand objects, for they are so, when we reflect
that civilisation, commerce and religion may through
them be spread over so vast an island as Borneo.
They are so grand, that self is quite lost when I consider
them; and even the failure would be so much
better than the non-attempt, that I could willingly
sacrifice myself as nearly as the barest prudence will
permit.’</p>

<p>Many, perhaps, could write such words, but Brooke
really felt them, and fully intended to carry out his
views, whatever obstacles might stand in his way;
and they were many, for on his return to Sarawak in
the <em>Royalist</em>, with the schooner <em>Swift</em> laden with goods
for the market, he found no house built and no cargo
of antimony ready. A house in Sarawak could be
built in ten days or a fortnight, as the materials are all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
found in the jungle and the natives are expert at the
work.</p>

<p>The antimony was procurable, but, as Brooke afterwards
found, it was the product of forced labour,
almost always unpaid. One cannot but smile at
Brooke’s first attempt at trade. Without sending up
to see whether the antimony was ready, he accepted
Muda Hassim’s word, and then handed over to him the
whole of the cargo of the <em>Swift</em>. What might have
been expected followed. No sooner had the Malay
rajah secured the goods than the most profound
apathy was shown as to the return cargo. The same
system was followed with regard to the government
of the country; every attempt to discuss it was evaded,
and I believe that Makota did his best to persuade
Muda Hassim that the Englishman was but a bird of
passage, who would soon get tired of waiting, and
would sail away without the return cargo, and drop
all thoughts of governing the country.</p>

<p>Pangeran Makota, who had been Brooke’s enemy
throughout all these proceedings, was now ready to
act. He knew that the Land Dyaks in the interior, as
well as the Malays of Siniawan whom the Englishman
had aided to subdue, now looked to him as their protector;
he therefore determined to destroy his prestige.
He invited the Seribas Sea Dyaks and Malays to come
to Sarawak; they came in a hundred bangkongs, or
long war boats, with at least three thousand men, with
the ostensible object of attacking a tribe living near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
the Sambas frontier, who had not been submissive
enough to Bornean exactions; but every violent act
they committed would have been overlooked if they
only gave a sufficient percentage of their captives to
the nobles. Already these wild devils had received
the rajah’s permission to proceed up the river; the
Land Dyaks, the Malays, the Chinese were full of fear,
as all are treated as enemies by the Seribas when out
on the war-path. As soon as Brooke received notice
of what Muda Hassim, instigated by Makota, had
done, he retired to the <em>Royalist</em> and prepared both his
vessels for action. The Malay rulers, hearing how
angry he was, and uncertain what steps he might
take, recalled the expedition, which returned, furious
at being baulked of their prey, and would have liked
to have tried conclusions with the English ships, but
found them too well on their guard.</p>

<p>This very act which Makota expected would lower
the Englishman’s prestige, naturally greatly enhanced
it, as it was soon known, even into the far interior, that
the white stranger had but to say the word and this
fearful scourge had been stayed.</p>

<p>Another event soon followed which greatly raised
Brooke’s influence among the natives. He received
notice that an English vessel had been wrecked on
the north coast of Borneo, and that the crew were
detained as hostages by the Sultan of Borneo for the
payment of a ransom. He now sent the <em>Royalist</em> to
try and release them, whilst he despatched the <em>Swift</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
to Singapore for provisions, and remained with three
companions in his new house in Sarawak. Could
anything better prove his cool courage? The <em>Royalist</em>
failed in its mission, but almost immediately after its
return, an East India Company’s steamer came up the
river to inquire as to its success, and finding the captive
crew still at Brunei, proceeded there and quickly
effected their release. The appearance of the <em>Diana</em>
twice in the river had its effect on the population,
as it was probably the first steamer they had ever
seen.</p>

<p>Makota had been greatly disappointed that his
intrigues had failed to force the white strangers to quit
the country, but his fertile invention now thought of
more sure and criminal means. ‘Why not poison
them?’ He tried, but failed; his confederates confessed,
and then Brooke resolved to act. Either
Makota or himself must fall. By a judicious display
of force, quite justified under the circumstances, he
freed the rajah from the baneful influence of Makota,
who from that time forward ceased to act as chief
adviser, and regained his former ascendency. Muda
Hassim immediately carried out his original promise,
and in a formal document handed over the government
of the district of Sarawak to Brooke. The news
was received with rejoicing by the Land Dyaks, the
Sarawak Malays and the Chinese, but with some
misgivings by the rascally followers of the Bornean
rajahs. This event took place in September 1841.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>Brooke’s first act was to request Muda Hassim to
return to their families the women and children who
had been given as hostages after the close of the
civil war. He succeeded in most cases, but as the
younger brothers of Muda Hassim had honoured with
their notice some of the unmarried girls, he was
forced to leave ten of them in the harems of the
rajahs.</p>

<p>Being now Governor of Sarawak, he determined to
effect some reforms. One of the greatest difficulties
he encountered was the introduction of impartial
justice; to teach the various classes that all were
equal before the law. He opened a court, at which
he himself provided, aided moreover, by some of the
rajah’s brothers and the chiefs of the Siniawan
Malays, and dispensed justice according to the native
laws, which in most cases are milder than those
of European countries. When absent himself his
chief officer acted for him. As long as these laws
were only applied to Dyaks, Chinese or inferior
Malays, there was no resistance, but when the
privileged class and their unscrupulous followers were
touched, there arose some murmurings.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="48" style="max-width: 85em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/48.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">SARAWAK
AND DEPENDENCIES</p>

<p class="center no-indent">MAP OF SARAWAK AND ITS DEPENDENCIES AT THE CLOSE OF SIR JAMES BROOKE’S GOVERNMENT.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Brooke saw at once that to ensure stability to his
rule he must govern the people through, and with the
aid of, the chiefs to whom they were accustomed.
He therefore proposed to Muda Hassim to restore to
their former positions the men who had been at the
head of the late rebellion, and who certainly had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
more sinned against than sinning. To this the rajah
agreed, which added much to the Englishman’s
influence, not only among the Malays, but also
among the Dyaks, who were accustomed to be ruled
and, it must be confessed, to be plundered by these
chiefs. But the tribes thought that it was better
to pay exactions to one than to be exposed to the
persecutions of many.</p>

<p>Although Muda Hassim had made over to Brooke
the government of the country, it was necessary that
this grant should be ratified by the Sultan. Brooke
therefore proceeded to Brunei in the <em>Royalist</em>, accompanied
by Pangeran Budrudin. It was also very
necessary to pave the way for Muda Hassim’s
return to the capital, with his rapacious followers,
before Sarawak could really prosper. Everything
succeeded; the Sultan not only ratified the grant, but
sent a strong invitation to his uncle to return to
his old position of being the prime minister, whose
absence they all deplored. His Highness sent letters
to that effect, and when the <em>Royalist</em> arrived at
Sarawak there was very general rejoicing.</p>

<p>The greatest state was observed when the Sultan’s
letters were taken on shore. ‘They were received and
brought up to the reception hall amid large wax
torches. The person who was to read them was
stationed on a raised platform. Standing near him was
the Rajah Muda Hassim, with a sabre in his hand; in
front was his brother Jaffer with a tremendous Lanun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
sword drawn; and around were the other brothers and
myself, all standing, the rest of the company being
seated. The letters were then read—the last one
appointing me to hold the government of Sarawak—after
which the rajah descended from the platform
and said aloud, “If anyone present disowns or contests
the Sultan’s appointment, let him now declare it.”
All were silent. “Is there any pangeran or young
rajah that contests the question? Pangeran Der
Makota, what do you say?” Makota expressed his
willingness to obey. One or two other obnoxious
pangerans, who had always opposed themselves to
me, were each in turn challenged, and forced to
promise obedience. The rajah then waved his sword,
and with a loud voice exclaimed, “Whoever he may
be that disobeys the Sultan’s mandate now received,
I will cleave his skull.” And at the moment some
ten of his younger brothers jumped from the verandah,
and drawing their long krises, began to flourish and
dance about, thrusting close to Makota, striking the
pillar above his head, and pointing their weapons at his
breast. A motion on his part would have been fatal,
but he kept his eyes on the ground and stirred not.
I too remained quiet, and cared nothing about this
demonstration, for one gets accustomed to these
things. It all passed off, and in ten minutes the men
who had been leaping frantically about, with drawn
weapons and inflamed countenances, were seated, quiet
and demure as usual. This scene is a custom with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
them, the only exception being that it was pointed so
directly at Makota.’</p>

<p>This unworthy chief was now ordered to leave the
country, as his presence was not only distasteful to the
Tuan Besar, as Brooke was called, but to all those whom
he had driven, by his oppressions, into the rebellion
which had lately been quelled. The Bornean rajahs
also looked upon him as an interloper, and he found
no support from them; he was said, in fact, to be a
stranger from the Dutch ‘sphere of influence,’ as it is
now the fashion to call possession without occupation.</p>

<p>A new era was about to dawn on Sarawak by the
advent of the British navy. Before dwelling on the
change which took place in consequence, let me
glance briefly at Brooke’s position. He had been
granted the government of the country by Rajah
Muda Hassim, a grant confirmed by the Sultan; he
had gained the confidence of the former, who leaned
on him for support, and who hoped through his
influence to recover his former paramount position
in the capital; he was cordially supported by the
Siniawan Malays, and was fully trusted by the Land
Dyaks. He was also aided to a certain extent by
those useful but troublesome subjects the Chinese,
who then only dreamt of making themselves supreme
in the interior. He was supported by three English
followers, and the occasional presence of his yacht, the
<em>Royalist</em>. How was it possible for anyone, therefore,
to declare that he had seized the country by force, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
held it by force, as was afterwards affirmed by a small
English faction? His only enemies were Pangeran
Makota and a few discontented Borneans, who
dreaded the reign of justice and order. Though
secure of the support of the inhabitants of Sarawak,
he was opposed by his neighbour the Sultan of Sambas,
backed by the Dutch, and he had the mouths of his
rivers almost blockaded during eight months of the
year by the fleets of Lanun and Balignini pirates who
cruised along the coast during the fine season. His
people were also in constant peril from the expeditions
organised by Sherif Sahib, the chief of the neighbouring
district of Sadong, the rendezvous of every species
of pirate; and all coast trade was stopped by the constant
presence of the Seribas and Sakarang Dyaks, led
by their warlike Malays, who foraged along the whole
western coast of Borneo. He was saved simply by
his great prestige, as he had in reality no force with
which he could cope with a large pirate fleet—a
prestige acquired by his bravery, his tact, his great
kindness, and the just and benevolent rule which he
was striving with all his energy to introduce into his
adopted country.</p>

<p>And what were his chief objects? How well the
following lines express them: ‘It is a grand experiment,
which, if it succeeds, will bestow a blessing on
those poor people, and their children’s children will
bless my name.’ Again, ‘If it please God to permit
me to give a stamp to this country which shall last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
after I am no more, I shall have lived a life which
emperors might envy. If by dedicating myself to
the task I am able to introduce better customs and
settled laws, and to raise the feeling of the people, so
that their rights can never in future he wantonly
infringed, I shall indeed be content and happy.’</p>

<p>This is how the Rajah describes his residence and
mode of life at Kuching: ‘I may now mention our
house, or, as I fondly call it, our palace. It is an edifice
fifty-four feet square, mounted on numerous posts of
the nibong palm, with nine windows in each front.
The roof is of nipa leaves, and the floors and partitions
are all of planks. Furnished with couches, table, chairs,
books, etc., the whole is as comfortable as man could
wish for in this out-of-the-way country; and we have
besides bathing-house, cook-house and servants’ apartments
detached. The view from the house to the
eastward comprises a reach of the river, and to the
westward looks towards the blue mountains of
Matang; the north fronts the river and the south
the jungle. Our abode, however, though spacious,
cool and comfortable, can only be considered a
temporary residence, for the best of all reasons, that
in the course of a year it will tumble down, from the
weight of the superstructure being placed on weak
posts.</p>

<p>‘The time here passes monotonously, but not unpleasantly.
Writing, reading, chart-making employ
my time between meals. My companions are equally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
engaged—Mackenzie<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> with copying logs, learning
navigation and stuffing specimens of natural history;
Crymble is teaching our young Bugis and Dyak boys
their letters for an hour every morning, copying my
vocabularies of languages, ruling charts and the like;
whilst my servant Peter learns reading and writing
daily, with very poor success, however. Our meals are
about nine in the morning and four in the afternoon,
with a cup of tea at eight. The evening is employed
in walking never less than a mile and a half measured
distance, and, after tea, reading and a cigar. Wine
and grog we have none, and all appear better for it,
or, at least, I can say so much for myself. Our bedtime
is about eleven.’</p>

<p>In 1843, after an almost unbroken stay of nearly
two years in Borneo, Brooke again visited Singapore,
and found welcome news. The British Government
had decided to inquire into the Bornean question, and
it was stated that Sir Edward Belcher had been
ordered to visit Sarawak in H.M.S. <em>Samarang</em>; but
what was of much greater importance, and proved of
incalculable benefit to Sarawak and to British interests
in Borneo, was that Brooke made the acquaintance of
Captain the Hon. Henry Keppel, who was in command
of H.M.S. <em>Dido</em>. As I have elsewhere remarked,
Keppel, with the instincts of a gentleman, at once
recognised that he had no adventurer but a true man
before him, and henceforward exerted all his energy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
and influence to further his friend’s beneficent projects.
They were indeed genuine Englishmen, and looked
to what would advance the veritable interests of their
own country—to increase its prestige in Borneo and
clear the seas of the pirates who destroyed native commerce
on its way to our settlements.</p>

<p>The <em>Dido</em> in the first days of May 1843 sailed from
Singapore for Sarawak, and on the 13th anchored off
the Moratabus entrance of the river. When the
natives heard that their Governor had arrived, they
swarmed down to the ship in their boats, delighted at
his return among them; and the sight of the beautiful
frigate, so powerful in their eyes, assured them that she
would not leave before some measures had been taken
against the pirates. Rajah Muda Hassim eagerly
seized on this opportunity to obtain some security for
native trade, and earnestly entreated Captain Keppel
to attack the pirates of Seribas and Sakarang, who
were especially dangerous to the coast traffic. Having
satisfied himself of the truth of the allegations against
the marauders, Keppel determined to act, and, having
announced his intention, he was soon assured of the
support of a native contingent, who decided to follow
their English chief wherever he went, although with
many misgivings as to the result of an attack on these
much-feared corsairs, who had plundered their coasts
with impunity for several generations.</p>

<p>I need not describe this expedition against the
pirates, as the details have been often published; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
as Admiral Keppel is now engaged in writing his
memoirs, we shall have full particulars at first hand.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
The <em>Dido</em> anchored off the Seribas river, and being
joined by a native force of five hundred men, the
English boats put off with crews of about eighty seamen
and marines, and carried in the most dashing
style every fort or obstruction placed in their way.
No obstacles daunted them, and their enemies,
numbering many thousands on each branch of the
river, were so astonished by this novel mode of fighting
in the open that they fled on every occasion,
abandoning their towns and forts, which were
promptly destroyed by our native allies, now trebled
in number. The Seribas considered themselves invincible,
and had collected their means of resistance
in well-chosen spots, their guns covering the booms
across the river, but to no purpose, and the towns of
Paku, Padi and Rembas all shared the same fate.</p>

<p>It is a very remarkable circumstance that as soon as
each section recognised the hopelessness of resistance,
they entered freely into communication with their
assailants, and under cover of the white flag, and often
unarmed, approached their English conquerors with
perfect trust and confidence. They all agreed to visit
Sarawak, and promised amendment for the future.</p>

<p>The complete collapse of the defence astonished
everyone, and those natives who had taken part in
this memorable campaign began to acquire confidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
in themselves, and were ever ready to follow their
white leaders in all future expeditions.</p>

<p>Captain Keppel, in his <cite>Voyage of the Dido</cite>, has given
us a very good account of the house in which Mr
Brooke lived in 1843, and of which I have already
introduced its occupant’s own description. Captain
Keppel says that the English Rajah’s residence,
although equally rude in structure with the abodes
of the natives, was not without its English comforts
of sofas, chairs and bedsteads. It was larger than any
other house in the place, but, like them, was built
on nibong piles, and to enter it it was necessary to
make use of a ladder. The house consisted of but
one floor; a large room in the centre, neatly ornamented
with every description of firearms in admirable
order and ready for use, served as audience hall and
mess room, and the various apartments around it as
bedrooms, most of them comfortably furnished with
matted floors, easy-chairs, pictures and books, with
much more taste and attention to comfort than
bachelors usually display. But, the fact is, you could
never enter any place where Brooke had passed a few
days without being struck by the artistic arrangement
of everything. His good taste was shown even in
trifles, though comfort was never sacrificed to show.
The house was surrounded by palisades and a ditch,
forming an enclosure, in which were to be found
sheep, goats, pigeons, cats, poultry, geese, ducks,
monkeys, dogs, and occasionally a cow or two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>Then, as later, the great hour of meeting was sunset,
when, after the preliminary cold bath to brace the
nerves, relaxed by the heat of the day, all the party
met to dine. When Keppel was at Kuching all the
officers of the <em>Dido</em> were welcome, and many a merry
evening was passed at Brooke’s house. I have often
heard him speak of that glorious time. Then the future
was all hope, no disappointments had depressed the
mind, and the cheerfulness of the host was infectious.
I have never met anyone who in his playful mood was
more charming. He told a story well, he was animated
in discussion, fertile in resource, and, when beaten in
argument, would shift his ground with great dexterity,
and keep up the discussion to the entertainment of
us all. An appreciative observer once wrote, ‘The
Rajah has certainly a most uncommon gift of fluency
of language. Every subject derives an additional
interest from his mode of discussing it, and his ideas
are so original that to hear him speak is like opening
out a new world before one. His views about Sarawak
are so grand that it is with real pain one thinks how
very little has been done to aid him in his noble
efforts.’ Captain Keppel was also a capital storyteller,
so that between the two, with occasional assistance
from the others, the time passed gaily, and it was often
well on in the small hours before the party broke up.</p>

<p>It was a great disappointment to all that Captain
Keppel now received orders to proceed to China, as
he had intended before his departure to complete his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
work by attacking the Sakarangs, who lived in the
interior of the Batang Lupar river, and who were
powerfully supported by Arab and Malay chiefs.</p>

<p>The next event of importance was the arrival of
Sir Edward Belcher in H.M.S. <em>Samarang</em>. He had
been sent to report on Sarawak and on Bornean affairs
in general. He was a clever but very unpopular man,
and made his ship the most uncomfortable in the service.
After a short stay in Sarawak, visiting the
interior and making inquiries, he decided to proceed
to Brunei and enter into communication with the
Sultan. Brooke was to have accompanied him, but
the <em>Samarang</em> had but just started to descend the
river when she touched on a rock, and as the tide fell,
she turned over on her side and filled with water. It
was a misfortune to the ship, but a blessing to Sarawak,
as it drew general attention to Brooke’s settlement.
By dint of the greatest exertion on the part of officers
and crew, and the aid afforded by the native population,
within eleven days the vessel was again afloat.
In the meantime the <em>Royalist</em> had been sent to Singapore
for provisions and aid, and before twelve days had
elapsed she returned with a ship of war. Others soon
followed, to find the <em>Samarang</em> out of all danger. As
soon as her refit was completed, she sailed for Brunei
with Brooke on board. His friends had pointed out
to him that, to render his work in Sarawak permanent,
he must obtain a grant in perpetuity from the Government
of Brunei, and this he readily secured. Moreover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
His Highness the Sultan wrote to Sir Edward
Belcher expressing the strong desire of his Government
to trade and their wish to co-operate in the suppression
of piracy.</p>

<p>Whilst all was proceeding favourably in Borneo,
Brooke was much disturbed by the news of the proceedings
of Mr Wise, his agent in London. There
was no doubt of the talent and earnestness of this man,
but those who knew him well felt that he was rather
working for his own benefit than for that of his
employer. He knew that a true account of the
actual state of Sarawak would fail to draw the attention
of the mercantile community; he therefore
raised false expectations as to the value of the trade
which would arise as soon as Borneo was thrown open
to British commerce. When Brooke was made aware
of this he wrote to his friend Templer, ‘It does
appear to me, judging from Mr Wise’s letters and the
steps he has taken, that some exaggerated hopes are
entertained, and hopes as unreasonable as exaggerated....
In fact, I will become no party to a bubble; or
gain, or accept any negotiation from Government upon
false grounds’ (<em>sic</em>).</p>

<p>Brooke’s views on the management of a wild country
and the only way to develop commerce among
savage, and even among half-civilised peoples, were
so wise and trustworthy that they would merit being
quoted in full did space permit. He was indeed a
most sagacious ruler, with a positive instinct as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
the manner in which native races should be treated,
and he always insisted that progress to be permanent
must be slow, and that throwing capital <em>en masse</em> into
an undeveloped country would only produce disappointment
and loss.</p>

<p>How true is the following: ‘Good temper, good
sense and conciliatory manners are essential to the good
government of natives, and on this point it is that most
Europeans are so grossly wanting. They always take
[with them] their own customs, feelings and manners,
and in a way force the natives to conform to them,
and never give themselves the trouble of ascertaining
how far these manners are repugnant to the natives.’
In my long experience I could scarcely name a dozen
men whom I have seen treat native races as they
should be treated, and most of these were among
the devoted followers of Rajah Brooke. His own
manners were perfect.</p>

<p>One result of the defeat of the Seribas was the
increased influence of the English ruler. Sherif Sahib
of Sadong now thought it prudent to return to the
Sow tribe of Dyaks fifty of the women and children
whom his people had seized, and although this was but
an instalment it was something gained.</p>

<p>In a few lines written on November 14, 1843,
Brooke sketched the policy which he wished the
English Government to pursue. ‘If we act, we ought
to act without unnecessary delay. Take Sarawak and
Labuan, or Labuan alone, and push our interest along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
the coast to Sulu, and from Sulu towards New Guinea,
gaining an influence with such states (and acquiring
dormant rights) as are clear of the Dutch on the one
hand and of the Spaniards on the other.’ But this
policy was neglected, and to some extent it is now too
late to carry it out.</p>

<p>In December 1843 Brooke again visited Singapore,
and there he shortly afterwards received news
of his mother’s death. Though affectionate to all
his relations, his love and tenderness centred in his
mother, and her loss was the more acutely felt, as,
from a mistaken feeling, the seriousness of her illness
had not been reported to him.</p>

<p>Whilst visiting Penang Brooke joined in an
expedition to punish some piratical communities on
the coast of Sumatra; and as a guest on board
H.M.S. <em>Wanderer</em>, he went with the boats that were
sent to attack the town of Murdoo. A strong current
swept the captain’s gig under an enemy’s stockade.
There was no help for it, so Brooke sprang out and led
a rush upon the fort, during which he received a gash
in the forehead and a shot in the arm. Reinforcements
coming up, the place was soon captured. On the
return of the expedition to Penang the ship’s crew
begged the captain’s permission to man yards and give
three cheers for their gallant guest. Here he met
Captain Keppel on his way to Calcutta, who promised
to pick him up at Singapore on his return and visit
Sarawak again, and chastise the pirates of Sakarang.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
Brooke therefore waited, but was again disappointed,
as the <em>Dido</em> was ordered to China, and he had therefore
to remain in the Straits until the end of May, when
Captain Hastings gave him a passage over to Borneo
in the <em>Harlequin</em>.</p>

<p>This long absence had encouraged his enemies, who
now hoped that they were free from their troublesome
neighbour. Sherif Sahib, however, though boasting
as loudly as ever, did not feel secure in Sadong, and
therefore prepared his vessels to remove himself and
all his immediate following to the interior of the
Batang Lupar river, where he would be in touch
with the other Arab adventurers who commanded
the different districts of that mighty stream. As a
defiance to Sarawak, he invited all the Sakarang
Dyaks to meet him at the entrance of the Sadong
river, and there they rendezvoused to the number
of two hundred Dyak bangkongs and Malay war
boats. Some mischief was done along the coast,
but Brooke surprised one of their expeditions and
captured several of their war vessels.</p>

<p>During Brooke’s absence from Sarawak, his new
house on the left bank of the river had been built on a
rising knoll between two running streams, with the
broad river flowing below. It was a pretty spot, and
now he could write, ‘I like couches, and flowers, and
easy-chairs, and newspapers, and clear streams, and
sunny walks.’ Here and there were planted and
tended with uncommon care some rose plants, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
Rajah’s favourite flower. ‘All breathes of peace and
repose, and the very mid-day heat adds to the stillness
around me. I love to allow my imagination to
wander, and my senses to enjoy such a scene, for
it is attended with a pleasing consciousness that the
quiet and the peace are my own doing.’</p>

<p>At length, however, the <em>Dido</em> came, accompanied
by the Company’s steamer <em>Phlegethon</em>, and it was
decided to begin operations by attacking the Arab
sherifs in their strongholds on the Batang Lupar
river.</p>

<p>The Batang Lupar for the first twenty miles looks
a noble stream. About that distance from the mouth
occurs the Linga, the first branch of the river which
leads to the Balow villages, inhabited by Dyaks under
the influence of Sherif Jaffer—the same Dyaks who
had joined Keppel’s expedition against the Seribas
pirates; they were warlike but not piratical. The
next branch on the left bank of the river was the
Undup, and then on the right bank the Sakarang, a
stream inhabited by a dense population of piratical
Dyaks; and about fifteen miles below the mouth of
that branch was built the town of Patusin, strongly
defended by forts and stockades.</p>

<p>As the arrival of the <em>Dido</em> had been fully expected,
the Sarawak preparations for the expedition were well
advanced, and in view of Keppel’s triumphs in the
previous year, there was no holding back, but all were
eager for the fray. Even Pangeran Budrudin was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
permitted to join the Sarawak contingent—something
quite new in the annals of the royal family.</p>

<p>On the 5th of August 1844 the expedition started,
and on the 6th was well within the river Batang
Lupar. By the 8th all was ready for the attack, and
on the rising flood tide the steamer and boats were
carried up stream at a bewildering pace, and soon
found themselves in face of the town and forts of
Patusin. The English boats formed up alongside of
the steamer, and pulled to the shore under a very hot
fire; but nothing could daunt their crews, and they
carried the forts by assault, with the loss of only one
English sailor killed and a few wounded. Nor were
the natives behindhand; they vied with their white
comrades, and were soon in full pursuit of the flying
enemy.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the force marched to the attack of
a neighbouring town where the chief Sherif Sahib had
his residence; but there was no resistance, and the place
was soon plundered and destroyed by our native allies.
Amongst the spoil captured at Patusin were sixty-four
brass guns and a smaller number of iron ones; the
latter were thrown into the river. Having completely
destroyed these Malay pirate settlements, not forgetting
that which had been formed by Pangeran
Makota, and handed over to the natives those war
boats which would be useful to them, while the remainder
were hacked to pieces and burnt, the force
prepared for an assault on the Sakarang pirates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>The attack on the Sakarangs was similar in its incidents
to that on the Seribas. The river was staked, but
nothing could stop the onset of the invaders. The town
was taken without much opposition; but the greatest loss
on the British side was incurred from the imprudence
of a scouting party. Brave old Patingi Ali had been
sent ahead to reconnoitre, when, probably urged on by
a Mr Stewart, who had been concealed in his boat, he
proceeded too far; and when a large force rowed down
the river to attack him, he found his retreat cut off
by long rafts which had been pushed off from the
banks and completely closed the river. He and his
party were overwhelmed, and out of seventeen men
only one escaped; Mr Stewart was among the killed.</p>

<p>Having completed their work, Captain Keppel and
Brooke pulled back to Patusin, where they were
joined by Sir Edward Belcher and the boats of the
<em>Samarang</em>. They now all returned to Sarawak, but
within a few days after their arrival the news came
that the Arab chiefs and their followers were collecting
at Banting on the Linga, the chief village of the
Balow Dyaks, under the protection of Sherif Jaffer.
The expedition immediately returned, and drove off the
intruders; and Pangeran Budrudin, in the name of the
Bornean Government, deposed Sherif Jaffer, and so
settled the country, under the advice of Brooke, that
comparative peace reigned there for nearly five years.</p>

<p>At this time it was calculated that Sarawak had
received an increase of five thousand families, or, more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
probably, individuals; it was a genuine proof of the
confidence of the people of the coast in the only spot
where peace and security could be obtained, but it was
also a sign of the terror inspired by the piratical fleets,
and the general bad government of the districts under
the rule of the native chiefs.</p>

<p>The greatest service Sir Edward Belcher ever did
for Sarawak was the removal of Muda Hassim to
Brunei. He had been long anxious to leave, but he
would not do so, except in state. So Sir Edward arranged
that not only the rajah and his immense family
should be received on board the Company’s steamer
the <em>Phlegethon</em>, but as many of his rascally followers
as possible; and then, with Brooke on board, the
<em>Samarang</em> set sail for Brunei. The expedition was
received with some suspicion, but ultimately Muda
Hassim and the Sultan were to all appearance reconciled,
and the former was restored to his position as
prime minister. An offer was made by the Sultan
to cede Labuan to England as a British settlement,
and that offer was transmitted to the English Government.
Labuan is an island off the mouth of the
Brunei and neighbouring rivers, which appeared
admirably adapted for a commercial and naval post,
and the discovery of coal there settled the point.</p>

<p>As soon as Muda Hassim had departed from
Sarawak, and Brooke was left, <em>de facto</em> as well as <em>de
jure</em>, the only governor, confidence in his remaining in
the country grew rapidly, and trade improved. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
the negotiations which his friends were carrying on
with the British Government moved slowly and drew
forth some impatient remarks from him. Henceforth
I may occasionally call him the Rajah, <em>par excellence</em>,
as he now was in truth the only rajah in Sarawak.</p>

<p>Hearing that some members of Sir Robert Peel’s
Government had stated that they did not understand
Brooke’s intentions, the Rajah wrote rather
indignantly—’December 31, 1844.... I am surprised,
however, that they say they do not understand
my intentions. Independently of my published
letter, I thought they had had my intentions
and wishes dinned into them. My intention, my
wish, is to develop the island of Borneo. How to
develop Borneo is not for me to say, but for them to
judge. I have, both by precept and example, shown
what can be done; but it is for the Government to
judge what means, if any, they will place at my disposal.
My intention, my wish, is to extirpate piracy by attacking
and breaking up the pirate towns; not only pirates
direct, but pirates indirect. Here again the Government
must judge. I wish to correct the native character, to
gain and hold an influence in Borneo proper, to introduce
gradually a better system of government, to open
the interior, to encourage the poorer natives, to remove
the clogs on trade, to develop new sources of commerce.
I wish to make Borneo a second Java. I intend to
influence and amend the entire Archipelago, if the
Government will afford me means and power. I wish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
to prevent any foreign nation coming on this field;
but I might as well war against France individually,
as to attempt all I wish without any means.’</p>

<p>Was this policy not clear enough? Had it been
followed, the independent portion of the Eastern
Archipelago would have been completely under our
influence, and would have ended by becoming practically
ours. We should have had New Guinea and
the islands adjacent, and thus given the Australians a
free hand to develop what certainly should be considered
as within their sphere of influence. How the
English Rajah’s policy was wrecked, I must explain
later on; at this time (1845) all seemed advancing
to its fulfilment.</p>

<p>In the meantime the British Government were
acting in their usual cautious, half-hearted way.
They did not really care a rush about Borneo or the
Eastern Archipelago, and I have no doubt that the
subordinate members of the Government offices looked
with disgust on those who were urging them to intervene
in Borneo. They hated any new thing, as it
forced them to study and find out what it was all about.
But as they could not stand still, they sent out Captain
Bethune to inquire. He arrived in February, in
H.M.S. <em>Driver</em>, and brought with him the temporary
appointment of Brooke as Her Majesty’s confidential
agent. This was a distinct advance, as he had now
to proceed to the capital to deliver officially a letter
from the Queen to the Sultan and the Government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
of Brunei. With Captain Bethune came Mr Wise,
the Rajah’s agent in England.</p>

<p>In Brunei they did not find Muda Hassim’s Government
very firmly established, as they were threatened
not only by Pangeran Usop, a connection of the
Sultan’s and a pretender to the throne, but by the
pirates of the north, with whom Usop was in league.
During their stay in Brunei, both Brooke and Captain
Bethune examined the coal seams near the capital,
but they do not appear to have been considered workable,
as no one has ever attempted to open a mine
there. The quality of the coal has been pronounced
good, and as the seams crop out of rather lofty hills
it cannot be considered as surface coal.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Hearing that Admiral Sir Thomas Cochrane was
expected in Singapore, the English Rajah determined
to proceed there to explain to him the true position
of affairs on the north-west coast of Borneo. He
found the admiral ready to take measures to suppress
piracy, and the Rajah left with the impression that
he would act against the great pirate chief, Sherif
Osman. In the meantime, he returned himself to
Brunei in the <em>Phlegethon</em> to find his Bornean friends
very despondent. However, in August the admiral
appeared, and at the invitation of the Sultan attacked
Pangeran Usop for holding two British subjects in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
slavery. This noble and his followers fled to the
hills. Sir Thomas then proceeded to Marudu Bay
to chastise Sherif Osman, the most notorious pirate
chief in the Archipelago. His place of residence, up a
narrow river, was carefully fortified with an extra strong
boom across the stream. A very powerful expedition
was sent up from the fleet. In attempting to force
their way through the well-prepared obstructions our
men were exposed to a murderous fire from the forts,
and we lost heavily; but the town was taken and
burnt. I visited the place afterwards, and was somewhat
surprised that a detachment was not landed below
the boom and the position turned; but we always
like to take the bull by the horns. The pirates
suffered severely. Sherif Osman was mortally wounded
and died shortly afterwards, and Marudu ceased for
a time to be a pirate rendezvous.</p>

<p>Returning to Brunei with the good news, Brooke
was delighted to hear that his friend Budrudin had
defeated Usop, who, with a force from the hills, had
come down to surprise the town, and had driven
him away from the neighbourhood of the capital.
He was some time afterwards taken at a place called
Kimanis, and by order of the Sultan was strangled
with all the formalities due to a person who had
royal blood in his veins. Thus Muda Hassim’s power
appeared securely established. His enemies without
and within had been defeated, and his warlike brother,
Lanun, on the mother’s side—which accounted for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
his unusual daring—was at the head of a strong
party. The English Rajah felt that they were comparatively
safe; yet he had his secret misgivings, and
tried in vain to persuade the admiral to station a brig
on the coast.</p>

<p>Captain Bethune now returned to England to make
his report to the British Government, and Brooke
was left to a welcome repose—doubly welcome after
all the exertions of the previous months.</p>

<p>It was during the summer of this year that a very
curious episode occurred. Whilst the Rajah was at
dinner with his English followers in the new house
to which I have already referred, and which had been
constructed some distance below the Malay town,
Lingire, the well-known pirate chief, walked into
the dining-hall, followed by a large party of his
warriors. As they were all fully armed, the Rajah
saw at once that mischief was meant. He received
the chief most courteously. A chair was given him,
and all the other Dyaks squatted down on the floor
round the table. Cigars were handed round, and
then the Rajah asked what was the news. Lingire
answered that they had just pulled up the river to
pay him a visit.</p>

<p>The Rajah called up a very intelligent native
servant and said to him in English, ‘Bring me another
bottle of sherry,’ and then added in a careless voice,
‘Let the Malay chiefs know who are here.’ The
servant duly brought in the wine and then retired.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
Whilst the Seribas chief was drinking his sherry, the
Rajah exerted himself to the utmost to entertain
him—told him story after story, got the Dyak to
relate instances of his own prowess. His vanity was
so tickled that, forgetting the object of his visit, he
dilated on his forays into the Dutch territories, where
he had surprised the Chinese settlers. ‘They won’t
fight, those cowards,’ he said. ‘They run away
from an armed man, or drop on their knees and beg
for mercy.’ The Rajah encouraged him to continue,
but time and the Datus moved slowly, and he could
see the Dyaks exchanging glances, as if to say the
moment had arrived for action. In another minute
they would have been on their feet and the unarmed
Englishmen slain, when footsteps were heard on the
gravel walk. Lingire looked anxious as the powerful
form of the Datu Patingi appeared in the verandah,
which was soon crowded with armed Malays. The
Datu Tumangong soon followed, and the Dyaks were
surrounded. They did not move—a move would
have sealed their fate. The Datus threatened and
scolded them to their hearts’ content, asked how
they had dared to enter the Rajah’s house with arms
in their hands, and had not the white chief interfered
the Malays would have executed summary justice on
the rascals.</p>

<p>The Rajah then spoke. He said he knew very
well that Lingire had come to surprise them, but
he would not have it said that anyone who came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
to his country should be in fear of death, however
much he merited it, that he would forgive him, and
he might go. At a sign from the Rajah the Malays
opened their serried ranks, and Lingire and his followers
crept out like whipped curs and disappeared from the
river. Years after I saw Lingire sitting on a chair
beside the Rajah, but I do not think he ever confessed
to us that his design had been to kill the white
men, though it was well known that he came for no
other purpose. He had, in fact, boasted that he
would take the Rajah’s head and hang it up in a
basket which he had already prepared and placed in
a tree near his village. Had he attacked the Rajah
the moment he entered the room nothing could have
saved the Englishmen, as they were quite defenceless;
and he could have done it with impunity, as no Malay
war boat could have overtaken a Dyak bangkong.
This is but a specimen of the Rajah’s marvellous
escapes. I had the above account from his cousin,
Arthur Crookshank.</p>

<p>The year 1846 opened satisfactorily. The attack
on the pirate haunts at Marudu, the punishment and
the subsequent death of Pangeran Usop, rendered
the position of Muda Hassim stronger, and the strict
watch kept on the Seribas and Sakarangs during 1845
had prevented any marauding on their part. Whilst
peace appeared now to be established both at home
and abroad, the Rajah was again troubled by the
action of his agent Wise. This clever but unscrupulous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
man kept writing that he would make Brooke the
richest commoner in England if he would give him
a free hand; and, in fact, without waiting for any permission,
he began to project large associations which
were to take over the country of Sarawak and rival
the old East India Company in wealth and power.
When Brooke understood what his agent was doing,
he wrote that he would be no party to such schemes,
and that he would not surrender Sarawak to the
tender mercies of a mercantile association.</p>

<p>I first made the acquaintance of Mr Wise in 1846,
and I well remember how lavish he was in the praise
of Brooke, and what hopes he entertained of the
success of an all-absorbing company. But as time
passed his enthusiasm for his friend and employer
gradually lessened, till the result was an open rupture.
To this I must refer hereafter.</p>

<p>1846, which opened under the finest auspices, soon
however changed its aspect. News came of marauding
on the part of the Sakarang Dyaks; but this
was trifling to what followed. H.M.S. <em>Hazard</em>,
Commander Egerton, had been sent by the admiral
to Brunei to communicate with Rajah Muda Hassim.
As soon as the ship anchored at the mouth of the
Brunei river, a native hurried on board, and by signs
made the officers understand that some great calamity
had occurred at the capital, while he appeared to warn
Egerton not to proceed up the river. Fortunately his
warning was attended to; and as he kept repeating in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
Malay, ‘Tuan Brooke’ and ‘Sarawak,’ the <em>Hazard</em>
weighed anchor and proceeded to that place. The
Malay brought serious news indeed. The Sultan had
ordered the murder of Muda Hassim, Budrudin and
the rest of the legitimate royal family, and had
succeeded in destroying the most important chiefs.
These were his own uncles and cousins.</p>

<p>A conspiracy seems to have been hatched among
the Sultan’s followers, who were the friends and
associates of the late Pangeran Usop, to kill Muda
Hassim and his family, not only for the sake of
revenge, but to prevent them gaining a preponderating
influence in the country. Already the people
were looking to them as the rising power, and the
Sultan’s prestige was visibly declining. Besides, with
their increasing influence they were acquiring too
many of the profits which used to accrue to the Sultan’s
<em>entourage</em>. As the representatives of the party which
preferred the old methods of government, the latter
disliked the alliance which was springing up between
this branch of the royal family and the Rajah of
Sarawak, as the representative of the English, and
therefore they found no difficulty in persuading the
half-imbecile Sultan that his immediate deposition
was meditated. He therefore gave the order that
Muda Hassim and his family should be attacked and
killed. Though warned that some conspiracy was
brewing, they took no heed, lulled in fancied security,
and were easily surprised. Muda Hassim defended his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
home with a few followers, but finding that they
would soon be overpowered, shot himself so as not
to fall into the hands of his enemies.</p>

<p>Pangeran Budrudin was attacked at the same time.
Brooke wrote to Keppel, on April 5th 1846, ‘After
fighting desperately and cutting down several of the
Sultan’s hired assassins, he was shot in his left wrist,
his shoulder and chest were cut open so as to disable
his right arm. A woman, by name Nur Salum, fought
and was wounded by his side. His sister and a slave
boy called Jaffir, though both wounded, remained by
him, the rest of his few followers having been cut
down or having fled. The four retired into the house
and barred the door. Budrudin, wounded and bleeding,
ordered the boy to get down a cask of powder, break
in the head and scatter it in a small circle. He then
told Jaffir to escape, gave him my signet ring, of
which I had made him a present, and told him to
beg me not to forget him and to tell the Queen of
England of his fate. He then called the women to
him, and when the boy had dropped through the
flooring into the water, fired the powder, and all three
were blown into the air.’ No hero could have died
more nobly, and what fine creatures must those
women have been!</p>

<p>No natives ever appear to consider or to care for
the consequences of their acts until the acts are done.
They are blinded by their hate; but no sooner had
the conspirators murdered the principal members of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
the royal family than they began to tremble for the
future. They knew the friendship which united
the English Rajah to Pangeran Budrudin, and began
to reflect that he would spare no pains to punish them.
With the death of this brave pangeran all hopes of
regenerating the Government of Brunei vanished.</p>

<p>At that time we had in the East an admiral who
dared to act—Sir Thomas Cochrane. When he heard
of the massacre he determined to proceed to Brunei
to inquire what was the meaning of these violent
measures. He rightly argued that the massacre did
not directly concern England, unless the Sultan was
about to repudiate all his engagements with us. On
his way he called in at Sarawak to see Brooke, and
to ask him, as the British Government’s confidential
agent, to accompany the expedition.</p>

<p>The squadron arrived off the Brunei river on the
6th June, and Sir Thomas immediately sent a message
to the Sultan, saying he was about to visit the capital
and desired an interview with His Highness. Some
messengers of inferior rank brought down the reply
that the admiral might ascend the river in two small
boats. No notice was taken of this restriction, and
the steamers, with the smaller vessels in tow, and
accompanied by the boats of the squadron, began to
ascend the river. As they neared the capital they were
received with volleys from every battery; but the
marines and blue-jackets were soon on shore, and
the defenders fled in haste. On entering the central<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
canal of Brunei, a battery at the Sultan’s Palace
opened fire, which did considerable damage to the
<em>Phlegethon</em>. There was no serious resistance, however,
and when the force took possession of the town they
found it completely deserted. The Sultan escaped
to the interior, and the party sent to capture him
naturally failed in their object.</p>

<p>A provisional government was established under
Pangeran Mumein, a respectable noble, not of royal
descent, and Pangeran Mahomed, a brother of Muda
Hassim, but not of much intelligence; then a proclamation
was issued, saying that the Sultan might
return to his capital if he were prepared to fulfil
his engagements.</p>

<p>Nothing ever raised the prestige of the English
so much as the capture of Brunei. As a military feat
of arms it was of no importance, but to the tribes
of the interior it was looked upon as a marvel of
heroism. They naturally thought Brunei to be the
only great power on earth, so that when they heard
that the English had taken their capital, they rejoiced
that their oppressors had received such a lesson.
Cautiously looking around to see that no Malay was
present, they would laughingly tell how they had
seen the Sultan and his nobles flying through the
jungle with the English at their heels, and ask
why having once taken the country we did not keep
it. These or similar inquiries were made wherever
I travelled in the interior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>Sir Thomas Cochrane, having seen the establishment
of the provisional government, sailed for China;
but during his passage up the north-west coast of
Borneo destroyed several pirate communities, and,
leaving Captain Mundy of H.M.S. <em>Iris</em> to complete
the work, proceeded to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>When Brooke returned to Sarawak he was indeed
received as the ‘Conquering Hero.’ The Malays
there were very much like the tribes of the interior,
thoroughly imbued with the idea that the Sultan of
Brunei was a great monarch, second to none; and
therefore the news that the capital had been taken
and that the Sultan had fled to the woods was a
complete surprise; but the surprise was only equalled
by the pleasure it gave, as the Brunei Government
was unpopular to the last degree, indeed hated for
its oppression.</p>

<p>While in Brunei Brooke collected those of the
families of Muda Hassim and his brothers who
wished to be removed from the capital, and brought
them down to Sarawak, where for years they were
supported by him.</p>

<p>1846 closed, as it had begun, with every sign of
prosperity. There was peace in all the neighbouring
districts, and the native trade on the coast was
considered to be very flourishing. Kuching, the
capital of Sarawak, was continually increasing, as the
natives removed to it from the less secure rivers, and
there was every hope that the British Government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
would now really make an effort to develop the
coast. They had decided to occupy the island of
Labuan and establish a commercial settlement there,
and this, it was expected, would lead to a more forward
policy.</p>

<p>Having received instructions from Her Majesty’s
Government, Brooke, in May 1847, proceeded to
Brunei to negotiate a treaty with the Sultan, which
should not only regulate the trade relations between
the two countries, but should contain a clause declaring
that British subjects committing offences within His
Highness’s dominions might only be tried by Her
Majesty’s representative. The treaty was signed, and
then Brooke left on board the Company’s steamer <em>Nemesis</em>,
Captain Wallace, who was on his way to Singapore.
When they arrived near the mouth of the Brunei river
they were hailed by a native prahu and were informed
that a Balignini pirate squadron was outside, capturing
fishing and trading boats. As soon as the <em>Nemesis</em>
rounded the sandy point of the island of Muara they
saw eleven Balignini prahus in full chase of a native vessel,
but as soon as the steamer appeared the pirates turned
towards the shore, and finding escape hopeless, pulled
into a shallow bay, anchored their vessels, bows seaward,
and all kept in position by hawsers connecting the
prahus to each other. The steamer arrived, when
the pirates immediately opened fire on her, and after
rather a prolonged action they cut their cables. Some
prahus pulled away to the north, others to the south,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
while the remainder were deserted by their crews.
It is needless to enter into details, but it may be
mentioned that in all the vessels taken were found
crowds of captives, principally from the Dutch
possessions. None of the prahus made the Balignini
Islands, as the three that escaped the steamer were so
riddled with shot that the crews had to take to their
boats, and after a painful voyage at last reached home.
The pirates of the eight other prahus were forced to
seek refuge on shore, and after committing some
murders and other excesses, were surrounded, and
then they surrendered to the Sultan, who had them
all put to death.</p>

<p>Peace being established along the north-west
coast by the energetic action of Sir Thomas Cochrane
and the wise policy of Brooke, the latter decided to
visit England after an absence of nearly nine years.
He knew that the action with the Balignini would
deter those pirates from visiting the coast for some
time; he was satisfied that the Brunei Government
could do no mischief; the Dyak pirates were still
under the influence of the punishment they had
received, and Sarawak was prosperous and safe. So
leaving his cousin, Arthur Crookshank, in charge,
he started for England, where he was sure to
be well received, as Captain Keppel’s successful
<cite>Voyage of the Dido</cite> had made the ruler of Sarawak
well known to all Englishmen.</p>

<p>After a tedious voyage Brooke landed in England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
on October 2nd, and was soon surrounded by friends
and relations. The Queen received him at Windsor
Castle, and he was so fêted by all that he had
but little time left to transact business. Brooke
could not but feel that his countrymen fully appreciated
the services he had rendered to England. He
was presented with the freedom of the City of London,
many clubs elected him a member by special vote,
Oxford honoured him with her distinctions. The
undergraduates went wild with enthusiasm at the
mention of his name, for he was pre-eminently a leader
to create that feeling among young men. He made
friendships, which were lifelong, with Earl Grey and
the Earl of Ellesmere.</p>

<p>Mr Wise gave him a grand dinner, and there
delivered a speech which was an unqualified eulogium on
his employer; it was not only eulogistic, it was fulsome
in his praise. I remember well all the circumstances,
and they are important; they impressed themselves
deeply in my mind. My father, who was present at
this dinner, when he came home, said to me, ‘I
cannot understand Wise. He has just made a speech
in which he has declared that Brooke is one of
the greatest and best of men, whilst privately he tells
me he is a robber and a murderer.’ On my father
asking for an explanation, Mr Wise excused himself,
saying that it was the necessity of his position which
forced him to dissemble.</p>

<p>Brooke, who before he left Borneo had been named<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
Commissioner and Consul-General, was now called
upon to accept the position of Governor of the new
settlement of Labuan, and was placed at the head of
an efficient staff. I was appointed secretary to the
Rajah, as Commissioner, and was thus brought into
the closest relations to him. We were all ordered to
hold ourselves in readiness to proceed to Borneo in
H.M.’s frigate <em>Meander</em>, Captain Keppel, on the
1st February 1848.</p>

<p>How high were our hopes when we sailed from
Portsmouth! They nearly made us forget the discomforts
of our position on board—discomforts almost
inseparable from an attempt to turn a ship of war
into a passenger vessel. Our progress appeared to
us slow, first from very stormy weather, and then
from incessant calms.</p>

<p>The <em>Meander</em>, though of forty-four guns, was but
a second-rate frigate; she had, however, a picked crew,
whom the fame of her captain had induced to join;
she was fitted with special boats for river service, as
she was intended to act against the pirate communities.
I need not dwell on the details of this
voyage, but I must introduce an anecdote related by
Sir Hugh Low of his great chief. ‘No circumstances,
however unexpected, flurried him.... I was once a
passenger with him in a large man-of-war. His
cabin was on the port side of the vessel, and he was
sitting in an arm-chair which leant against the bulkhead.
I was stretched on a locker on the opposite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
side of the cabin, and there being a fresh breeze the
ship was heeling over to starboard, when we felt
a sudden increase in the lurch, which threw me
headlong against the lee bulkhead, the Rajah’s chair
being tilted up so that his feet were in the air.
I attempted to crawl towards the door, when the
Rajah, who had been reading, asked me where I was
going. I said, “I am going to see what is the
matter; the vessel is capsizing.” He replied, “You
have nothing to do with it; you are only a passenger.
Stay where you are.” The danger was averted by
the promptness of the carpenter, who with one stroke
of his sharp axe severed the main brace, and the vessel
immediately righted itself.’</p>

<p>We were all glad to reach Singapore, for although
the officers did their utmost to make us
comfortable, it was not possible that much success
could attend their efforts. I daresay they were as
pleased to see us land as we were to find ourselves
on shore. One thing I may mention, however; the
gun-room officers pressed me to remain with them
instead of facing the expense and discomforts of a
Singapore hotel; but I could not avail myself of their
kindness as I had my secretary’s duties to perform.</p>

<p>About three weeks after our arrival, the surveyor,
the late Mr Scott, afterwards Sir John Scott, and
Captain Hoskins, harbour-master, were sent ahead to
prepare the necessary buildings for the officers that
were to follow. This was our first mistake. Neither<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
of these gentlemen knew anything about tropical
countries, nor even the language of Borneo, and
fixed the site of the settlement on a grassy plain, that
turned into a swamp as soon as the rainy season
commenced. Had the Lieutenant-Governor, Mr
Napier, been sent ahead, or had Mr Low (now Sir
Hugh Low), the Colonial Secretary, accompanied the
advance party, their special knowledge of the Tropics
would have saved us the consequences of this
disastrous error. After a long and apparently unnecessary
delay of three months and a half at Singapore,
we sailed in the <em>Meander</em> for Sarawak. Before
our departure, however, news arrived that Her Majesty
had been pleased to name Mr Brooke a K.C.B., and
he was duly installed before we left that British
settlement.</p>

<p>On September 4, 1848, the <em>Meander</em> anchored
off the Muaratabas entrance of the Sarawak river,
and the reception accorded to their Rajah by the
native inhabitants made a deep impression, not only
on me, but on all who witnessed it. The whole
population turned out to meet him, and the river,
as far as the eye could reach, was thronged with
boats. Everything that could float was put into
requisition—the trading vessels, the war boats carrying
their crews of a hundred, a few unwieldy Chinese
junks, and every canoe in the capital. All were
gaily dressed, and the chiefs crowded on board the
frigate. At 1 p.m. we left under a royal salute,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
with yards manned and hearty cheers from the crew,
and started for a six hours’ pull to the capital. We
arrived after sunset and found every house brilliantly
illuminated. The Rajah’s reception at Government
House, where all the English were assembled, was
naturally very hearty, and soon the whole place was
crowded with natives.</p>

<p>Finding that during his absence the piratical tribes
had recommenced their raids on the neighbouring
towns, the Rajah thought of forming a league of the
well-disposed districts, and therefore introduced a
flag, which was not only a Sarawak flag, but might
be used by any member of the league. This flag was
hoisted, with great ceremony, on the staff in front of
the Government House, and it is now used along the
whole coast as far as, and in a place or two beyond,
the Sultan’s capital.</p>

<p>About this time a mission, under the auspices of the
Church of England, was established in Sarawak, and
great hopes were entertained of its success.</p>

<p>I may as well mention who were the members of
the Rajah’s staff. While we were at Kuching, his
nephew, Captain Brooke of the 88th, joined him as
A.D.C., but as he was to be the Rajah’s heir in
Sarawak it was thought he would soon retire from
the army; then Arthur Crookshank, who had hitherto
represented him in Borneo; Charles Grant, his private
secretary; Brereton, at that moment unattached; and
myself, secretary to the Commissioner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>In the first days of October we embarked on board
the <em>Meander</em> and sailed for Labuan, where we arrived
on the 7th. Labuan lies, as I have stated, off a
large bay, into which flow the Brunei, the Limbang,
the Trusan, and many other rivers, and seemed well
adapted for a commercial and naval station. It has
a fine harbour and plenty of coal, and as we arrived
on a bright day, the place looked very attractive.
A broad grassy plain, which skirted the harbour, was
about three quarters of a mile deep, then it met the
low hills and thick jungle. Our houses had all been
constructed near the sea, with the plain behind us,
and their neat appearance, although only of native
materials, quite delighted us. Keppel soon sailed to
tow down to Singapore H.M.S. <em>Royalist</em>, which had
been dismasted by a sudden squall, and we were left
to the care of a few marines and blue-jackets.</p>

<p>The south-west monsoon was now blowing
fiercely, and brought up with it heavy clouds and
drenching rain, and our plain speedily became a fetid
swamp, which laid many low with fever and ague.
In an interval of fine weather we proceeded to
Brunei in the <em>Jolly Bachelor</em>, a vessel belonging to
the Rajah, but manned by blue-jackets, the steam
tender <em>Ranee</em> and some other boats, to ratify our
treaty with the Sultan, and found prepared for us a
long, low shed of a house, in which we all took up our
quarters. Brunei was in truth a Venice of hovels, or
rather huts, perched on posts driven into the mud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
banks found in the broad river. Everything looked
as though it were falling to decay—the palace, the
mosque, the houses of the pangerans, in fact, the
whole city of perhaps 20,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p>The wretched Sultan was even then suffering from
a disease—cancer on the lip—which carried him off a
few years subsequently. He was a mean-looking
creature, and his previous atrocities had earned for
him the description, ‘the head of an idiot and the
heart of a pirate.’ After finishing our business we
returned to Labuan.</p>

<p>I never spent such a wretched month as that of
November 1848. After a short respite the south-west
monsoon began to blow again, the rain fell in
torrents, the sea was driven up to such a height that
the waves washed under all our houses, which were
built on piles, and destroyed many of our stores.
The Rajah’s English servant attributed the diminution
of the wine and brandy to the same cause.
Fever was soon upon us. First the marines and blue-jackets
fell ill and many died; then all our Chinese
workmen and Kling servants; then Sir James Brooke,
the Lieutenant-Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the
Colonial Doctor, Captain Brooke, Mr Grant, and
many others were down with this weakening disease.
The only ones to escape were Mr Scott and myself.
Admiral Collier arrived during this period, and fled,
panic-stricken, from the place, and ever after did all in
his power to injure the colony, and certainly did what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
he could to keep Her Majesty’s vessels away, though
those on board ship scarcely ever suffered. There was
gloom in every house; even the Chinese would not stay,
and went over to establish themselves in the capital.</p>

<p>Fortunately the barracks for the Madras garrison
had been built on the swelling ground at the back of
the plain, and to this place the Governor sent all those
he could. While there they quickly recovered, and
it was decided to have fresh houses built for the whole
staff near the military quarters.</p>

<p>At the end of November the weather began to
improve, as the north-east monsoon made itself felt,
and the <em>Meander</em> fortunately arrived, and Keppel
insisting, Sir James and some of his staff were embarked
on board, and we sailed along the north-west
coast on the way to Balambangan Island, where an
English vessel had been wrecked. Finding her burnt
to the water’s edge, Sir James decided to proceed to
Sulu and visit the Sultan.</p>

<p>At Sugh, the capital, we found both coolness and
hesitation. Some Dutch vessels had lately bombarded
the town, and the Sultan had not forgotten our
attack on Sherif Osman of Marudu Bay. This chief
had married a relative of his, and his death after the
engagement with the English was still remembered.
Besides, there were some survivors and many relatives
of those killed in the engagement in May 1847,
against whom it was necessary to take every precaution.</p>

<p>Whatever was the motive, the Sultan got over his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
soreness of heart, and determined to see the great
white chief whose fame had long since reached his
ears. He and the people were soon assured that the
English had no hostile intentions, and shortly after
our arrival a reception was arranged.</p>

<p>The Sulu Islands were claimed by the Spaniards,
but they had never made good their claim, for
although they had sent several expeditions against
the Sultan, which were followed by treaties, these
were seldom observed by either side. The islands
themselves are as beautiful as, perhaps more beautiful
than, any others I have ever seen, well cultivated and
producing all the food the natives required, but
their commerce appeared very limited. They were
the principal rendezvous of the Balignini and Lanun
pirates, and consequently a slave emporium. The
products of the sea, such as pearls and mother-of-pearl—<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bêche
de mer</i>—so prized by the Chinese, were
the most valued articles of trade, a large portion of
which, however, came from the islands further east.
The proceeds of the plunder sold by the pirates were
too often invested in guns and powder.</p>

<p>Sulu is nominally governed by a Sultan and a
council of nobles, who, however, possess but limited
authority over the population of the thousand and
one isles.</p>

<p>The Sultan and his nobles received us in such state
as they could manage in a hurry, since after the late
attack on them by the Dutch their valuables had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
been sent to the mountains. Their reception of the
English envoy was most kind. As Sir James did not
wish to introduce business during this visit, our intercourse
was purely formal, and after mutual inquiries
as to the state of our health, and a curious reference
made by the Sultan to the recent revolution in France,
we took our leave. The Sultan was a young man,
pale and emaciated, the result, it was said, of too
much indulgence in opium.</p>

<p>The <em>Meander</em> soon sailed from Sulu, and after
calling at Samboangan, the Spanish penal settlement
in the island of Mindanau, we returned to our colony
of Labuan, where we were pleased to find that all the
officers were well, and that they had removed from
the swampy plain to the higher land behind it. There
was, however, but little progress visible, as the fever
panic still prevailed. We did not stay long here, as
the Rajah was anxious to begin operations against
the Seribas and Sakarang pirates, who had again commenced
to ravage the coast. We reached Sarawak
on the 16th February. A daring attack of the Seribas
Dyaks on the Sadong district, when they captured
over a hundred heads, made us move out with our
native fleet to pursue them, but a return of the
north-east monsoon drove us to shelter. Later on,
accompanied by the boats of the steamer <em>Nemesis</em>, we
destroyed some of their inland villages, and thus kept
them quiet for a time.</p>

<p>To crush these pirates, however, we required a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
stronger force, and had to wait for the arrival of one
of Her Majesty’s ships. In the meantime, in order
to save the independence of Sulu, threatened both by
the Dutch and the Spaniards, Sir James determined
to proceed there in the steamer <em>Nemesis</em> and negotiate
a treaty. After calling in at Labuan, we continued
our course to the Sulu seas. We were received by
the Sultan and nobles in the most friendly manner,
and Sir James had no difficulty in negotiating a treaty
which, had it been ratified and supported, would
have effectually preserved the independence of the
Sultan. Our intercourse with these people was most
interesting. Preceded by his fame, Sir James soon
made himself trusted by the brave islanders, and
one proof was that the Sultan asked him to visit him
in a small cottage, where he was then staying with a
young bride. I was among those who accompanied
our Rajah, and on the darkest of dark nights we
groped our way there. The Sultan was almost
alone, and he soon began to converse about his
troublesome neighbours, the Dutch and the Spaniards,
expressing a strong hope that the English would
support him.</p>

<p>Sir James explained to him our position in Labuan,
and cordially invited his people to come and trade there,
assuring him that the English had no designs on the
independence of their neighbours, but that they only
wanted peace and the cessation of piracy. One or two
nobles dropped in, and the conversation turned on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
the subject of hunting, and our hosts proved themselves
eager sportsmen, and invited us to return when
the rice crop was over and they would show us how
they hunted the deer, both on horseback and on foot.
The Sultan, during the evening, took a few whiffs of
opium, whilst the rest of the company smoked tobacco
in various forms. The women were not rigidly excluded,
as they came and looked at us whenever
they pleased; but we could not see much of them,
and it is a form of politeness to pretend not to notice
their presence. After a very enjoyable evening, we
bade farewell to the Sultan, as we were to sail the
following day.</p>

<p>Sir James Brooke had intended to return there,
establish himself on shore for a month, and join the
nobles in their sports, and thus acquire a personal
influence over them. He thought he could wean
them from intercourse with the pirates and turn them
into honest traders. It must be confessed that when
we were there we had abundant evidence that the
Balignini and Lanun pirates did frequent the port to
sell their slaves and booty and lay in a stock of
arms and ammunition. Sir James was, however,
persuaded that if British war steamers showed themselves
every now and then in Sulu waters, the pirates
would abandon these seas. The moment was propitious;
the Spaniards had just destroyed the haunts
of Balignini, capturing many and dispersing the rest.
The sanguinary defeat of eleven of their vessels in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
1847, by the <em>Nemesis</em>, was not forgotten, and it
required but a little steady patrolling to disgust the
nobles with this pursuit; in fact, many had sold their
war vessels and guns, saying, that now the English
steamers were after them, it was no longer the
profession of a gentleman. I never met natives who
pleased me more; the young chiefs were frank, manly
fellows, fond of riding and hunting, and our intercourse
with them was very pleasant. It was always
a matter of regret with me that I never had an
opportunity of visiting them again.</p>

<p>Leaving Sulu, we called in at Samboangan, and
had a very agreeable time with the acquaintances we
had previously made there. We saw how little the
Spaniards had done to develop the immense island of
Mindanau. Here and there on the coast were some
small settlements, with cultivation extending but a
few miles inland, but there was a great air of neatness
about the places dotted along the coast.</p>

<p>On our return voyage we touched at Labuan, and
then went on to Sarawak, where we found H.M.’s
brig <em>Albatross</em>, Commander Farquhar, and the <em>Royalist</em>,
Lieutenant-Commander Everest. The <em>Nemesis</em> proceeded
on to Singapore, but soon rejoined us.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="96" style="max-width: 120.5em;">

AND FEDERATED MALAY STATES.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The expedition which was now organised was the
largest that ever left the non-piratical districts for the
punishment of the marauders. Besides the steamer
<em>Nemesis</em>, we had the boats of the <em>Albatross</em> and
<em>Royalist</em>, and about one hundred native prahus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
manned by between three and four thousand men. I
have in another work so fully described this expedition
that I will not give a fresh account, but content
myself with a summary of our proceedings. As a
turning point in the history of the coast it will ever
be remembered, not only as the greatest blow that
was ever struck at Dyak piracy, and practically its
destruction, but also because it led to the great
misfortune that Sir James Brooke considered it
necessary to retire from the public service, a step
which was forced upon him by the weakness of
Lord Aberdeen’s Government and the malice of
his enemies.</p>

<p>On the 24th July 1849 the <em>Nemesis</em> started with
the <em>Royalist</em>, the <em>Ranee</em> tender, and seven English
boats in tow, and we followed in the evening with
our powerful native contingent. The campaign, as
planned by the authorities, was to proceed up the
great river of Rejang, and attack the pirate communities
from inland; but on our way to the mouth
of that river we received information that ninety-eight
Seribas war boats had pulled along the coast towards
our point of rendezvous, the Rejang. It was instantly
decided that on its return we should attempt to intercept
this fleet, and our force was divided into
two squadrons, one to guard the entrance of the
Seribas, the other the mouth of the next river to
the north, the Kaluka.</p>

<p>After two days’ waiting, our spy boats, at sunset on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
the 31st, brought intelligence of the approach of the
pirate fleet. When they saw us at the mouth of the
Kaluka, they gave an exultant shout and dashed away
for home, but their hopes soon vanished as they were
met by the <em>Nemesis</em>, the English boats, and the mass
of our native fleet. Some turned to escape by the
Kaluka, but were driven back and pursued by our
light division. They now lost all hope of being
able to get away in their heavy bangkongs; they
therefore ran them on shore and escaped into the
jungle.</p>

<p>In the morning the Rajah received a note from
Farquhar to say that he had gone up the Seribas with
the steamer to prevent any of the pirate boats escaping,
but the few who had forced their way through the
blockading squadron were already far beyond his
reach. Our division then proceeded to the mouth of
the Seribas. What a sight it was! Seventy-five of
their war boats were lying on the sands, eighteen had
been sunk at sea, and twelve alone escaped up the
river. Such a defeat had never before been known.</p>

<p>These war boats were very different from what
have been described by certain critics. I measured one.
It was eighty feet in length, nine in breadth, and its
pulling crew must have consisted of at least seventy men.
The pirates murdered all their girl captives, and, after
shocking mutilations, cut off their heads and escaped.
We soon had ample proof of the piracies committed
by this fleet. Not only had they attacked villages on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
shore, but they had captured two large native vessels
on their way to and from Singapore. It would have
been easy to have destroyed the fugitive pirates by
occupying a narrow isthmus over which they must
pass, but Sir James Brooke, convinced that this great
defeat would have full effect, called off his excited
native followers to the attack of the interior strongholds.</p>

<p>During our stay in the districts of Paku, we lost
some men from the over-confidence of the sons of the
Orang Kaya Tumangong of Lundu, who advanced to
clear the path by which we were to march on the
town. They were stooping to pull out the <em>ranjaus</em>
when the Seribas, headed by Lingire, sprang upon them,
and cut down two, while the third son escaped, as a
party of our Malays poured a volley into the enemy
and killed several of them. However, we advanced
next day and laid their country waste, our native
contingent loading themselves with plunder. Having
showed the pirates that no defences could prevent our
punishing them, it was decided to carry out the
original plan and attack those Sakarang and Seribas
Dyaks who lived on the Kanowit, a branch of the
great Rejang river, about a hundred miles from the
mouth of the latter. These men were most feared
by the inhabitants of the Sago districts, which were
situated near the western entrances of the mighty
stream.</p>

<p>Many of our native allies now left us, as they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
loaded with plunder and were not provisioned for so
long a voyage; so we proceeded with the <em>Nemesis</em>, the
English boats, and our principal Malay war prahus,
and as soon as we appeared on the Rejang fresh bodies
of natives began to join us, eager to retaliate upon
those who had so often attacked them and captured
their trading vessels. The Rejang is a splendid river,
destined some day to be an important highway of
commerce, as its various branches open out a large
extent of country, and it penetrates further into the
great island of Borneo than any other stream on the
north-west coast.</p>

<p>The <em>Nemesis</em> towed many of the boats up to the
entrance of the Kanowit branch, and anchored there
whilst the expedition pushed up to attack the great
pirate chief Buah Ryah, who had established his
quarters in the interior of this broad river. We
advanced rapidly, and were within one day’s pull of
his forts, while Captain Brooke, with the light division
of fast-pulling boats had reconnoitred some miles
ahead, and found that the pirates were beginning to
show in great numbers, which made us feel assured
that we should soon be in touch with the main body.
We landed to inspect a large village house, which was
surrounded by a cotton plantation, and found it well
built, and full of baskets of the skulls of the unfortunates
who had been surprised by these marauders.
I counted three hundred heads in one village. We
then fell down the river to join Sir James Brooke and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
the English force, in great spirits at the prospect of
coming in contact with the enemy next day. We
were therefore astonished to hear, on our arrival, that it
had been decided to give up the object of our expedition
and return. As dinner was over, we removed to a
short distance from our chiefs to have our meal in quiet,
and to express to each other our indignation at the decision
to which our naval commander had come. Some
others joined us, equally disappointed. Towards the end
of the meal, I could not help raising my glass and saying
aloud, ‘Oh, for one hour of bonnie Keppel!’ Captain
Farquhar sprang up and came over to us to inquire
what I meant. We told him why we considered his
determination very detrimental to the cause, as we
were approaching Buah Ryah’s stronghold. He urged,
however, the fatigue of his men, who had been pulling
many days in succession against a strong current. We
proposed a day’s rest, but on a hint from Sir James I
gave up the discussion. He thought as I did, that
Buah Ryah would, with some reason, proclaim that
we were afraid to attack him, and would be thus
encouraged to hold out. This actually happened, and
thus the pacification of these districts was delayed for
many years. There is no doubt that the English
sailors were really tired, and possibly also dissatisfied,
as all the skirmishing was done by our native contingent,
who forged ahead of the slow-pulling men-of-war’s
boats. How we missed the special boats of
the <em>Meander</em>! The sailors, however, might have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
sure that had there been any real fighting ahead, all
would have waited for them.</p>

<p>As we gloomily fell down the river we met
thousands of natives who were coming to join our
expedition, and who were desperately disappointed
that Buah Ryah had not been punished. When near
the mouth of the Kanowit we were hailed by the
inhabitants of the villages we had destroyed. A conference
ensued; they showed their faith in the white
man by boldly pulling out to our prahus. They did
not attempt to deny their piracies, but promised amendment;
and most of these chiefs kept their word.</p>

<p>As we returned towards Sarawak the native chiefs
of all the trading towns on the coast came to express
their unbounded thanks to the English Rajah and to
the Queen’s forces for the punishment they had inflicted
on the pirates, and the prospect it held out of
trade being carried on free from danger of pillage and
death.</p>

</div>


<p class="no-indent">We were fairly contented with the results of the
recent expedition, and thought that all would be
satisfied with our efforts to put down piracy and
protect trade. We were therefore greatly surprised
on our arrival in Sarawak to find that two English
papers had commenced violent attacks on our proceedings,
founded at first on some reports of excesses
by our native allies during our expedition in the
spring, when we punished the pirates at the Kaluka
river. At the time we suspected, and it was
clearly proved afterwards, that the originator of
this campaign against the Rajah was Mr Henry
Wise, Sir James’s discarded agent.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that Mr Wise had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
accidentally entrusted with a mass of the Rajah’s
private correspondence with his mother and with
Mr John Templer; in the former Mr Wise found
the expression, ‘A friend was worth a dozen agents’;
and in the latter such words as, ‘If Wise does not obey
my instructions I will kick him to the devil.’ Mr
Wise was by nature vindictive, and it was not surprising
that he was somewhat roused by such freedom
of expression, though it occurred in confidential letters
to the Rajah’s most intimate friends. The reason
why these energetic remarks had been made was Sir
James’s discovery that Wise was trading on his great
name, and (as already stated) endeavouring to form
companies with very large capital to develop the
resources of Sarawak. The Rajah tried in vain to
stem this current by pointing out that there could be
no employment for a large capital in a new country,
and that everything must advance gradually. This
would not have suited Wise’s views, which were to
gain for himself a large fortune, careless as to who
suffered in the process.</p>

<p>Mr Wise succeeded in floating the Eastern Archipelago
Company, with a nominal capital of £100,000,
and managed so to mystify the directors that they
agreed to accept his own terms, by which he would
have monopolised nearly all the profits. But notwithstanding
that there were some respectable names
among the directors the public did not come forward,
and all, or nearly all, of the shares remained in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
hands of the company. The City would not help, as
it soon became known that capitalists of undoubted
strength had been ready to find the money, but were
suspicious of Mr Wise’s refusal to state his terms
before the company was formed.</p>

<p>Having secured, as he thought, three thousand a year
for certain, with other great advantages in prospect,
Mr Wise threw off the mask, and now declared to
Government that he could no longer associate himself
in any way with Sir James’s sanguinary policy. He
forgot entirely that his company had been formed to
take advantage of the English Rajah’s unique position
in Borneo, so as to develop its resources and to work
the coal in Labuan, of which colony Sir James Brooke
was Governor.</p>

<p>Mr Wise was soon in communication with the
press, but the majority saw through the discarded
agent, and would have nothing to do with his pretended
disclosures. He succeeded, however, in gaining
the ear of Joseph Hume, who promised to bring the
case before Parliament, and managed to win over to
his side Mr Cobden, and, to a lesser degree, Mr Bright.
I must here observe that because Mr Cobden advocated
Free Trade with great ability and success, his
followers appear to consider that words must not
be applied to him which he was ready enough to
apply to others. Many pretended to be shocked that
Sir James Brooke answered these attacks with his
characteristic energy; and I remember meeting one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
of the foremost statesmen of the present day at a
dinner on my return from Borneo in 1860, who, in
reply to a question of mine, said that the language
which Sir James Brooke had employed when speaking
of ministers had prevented them from restoring
him to his position in the public service or showing
their appreciation of the great good he had done. It
took my breath away. After they had heaped on him
every humiliation which was possible, he was to sit
quiet and bear it. It was not, however, in his nature
to sit quiet when calumny after calumny was propagated
by his enemies. I will allow that his
language was strong and occasionally injudicious,
but we must remember the provocation, and that his
heart was set on the safety of Sarawak. I must add
that not one of those around him ever attempted to
increase his indignation; on the contrary, we urged
him to treat these attacks with contempt.</p>

<p>After having spent one hundred and sixty days in ships
and boats during the first eight months of 1849, we
were, indeed, glad of a little rest. The squadron now
dispersed, Her Majesty’s ships sailed for Singapore;
Captain Brooke, suffering from fever, went to China for
a change; and Grant and I remained with the Rajah.
Though quiet, we were busy, as deputation after
deputation arrived from the pirate rivers to express
their firm determination to give up piracy, and
messengers came from the distant inland tribes to
interview the Rajah, ‘for the Dyaks had heard, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
whole world had heard, that the Son of Europe was
the friend of the Dyak.’</p>

<p>We also visited several of the interior tribes, and the
manifold proofs that the Rajah witnessed of the great
advance made by those poor and humble subjects of
his raj must have been pleasing to him.</p>

<p>It was during these quiet months that we gave
ourselves up to the library. The Rajah was a good
reader, and it was a treat to hear him read Miss
Austen’s novels, which were great favourites of his.
He was also very fond of religious discussions, and
I think we listened to the whole of the long controversy
between Huxley and Priestley, and heard
all Channing’s Essays. Whatever the Rajah touched
appeared to gain an additional brightness. He was
always gay and full of fun, and dearly loved an
argument.</p>

<p>Every evening the native chiefs came in to talk
to the Rajah, who supplied them with cigars, and it
was from these conversations that he gained that
minute knowledge of the local politics of every
district, which served him so admirably when he
had to deal with the chiefs along the coast. The
Rajah had the rare gift of never forgetting a name
or a face. One evening a poor Milanau came in, and
after touching the Rajah’s hand, squatted on the floor,
and remained silent, as many chiefs were present.
‘I have seen that man before,’ said Sir James; and
presently he turned round and addressed the native<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
by name, and said, ‘Bujang, what is the news from
Bintulu?’ This man had piloted a steamer into that
river ten years previously, and the Rajah had never
seen him since.</p>

<p>Finding he could not shake off the fever and ague
contracted during our expeditions, Sir James decided
to proceed to the island of Penang, one of the Straits
Settlements, where he had been offered the use of
Governor Butterworth’s bungalow on a hill more than
two thousand feet above the sea level. Hearing, however,
that his officers in Labuan were at loggerheads,
he decided first to proceed to that colony and investigate
the cause of these dissensions. We left Sarawak
on the 11th December, reaching our destination on
the 14th; and it was time indeed that the Governor
should arrive. Our few days were prolonged to over
ten weeks, as an inquiry had to be instituted into
the conduct of the Lieutenant-Governor. Though I
do not think that anything was proved against his
personal honour, it was clearly established that his
violent temper and quarrelsome disposition rendered
him unsuited for the position, and Sir James Brooke
suspended him from his functions.</p>

<p>While this inquiry was going on, we proceeded
to Brunei to see the Sultan, and heard, whilst we
were in the capital, that the Chinese traders were
most anxious to remove to our colony, but I do not
believe they ever really intended to do so. They
had built houses for themselves in the capital, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
were doing a thriving trade on a small scale; and
unless they all agreed to move at the same time, none
would move. The Bornean Malay traders also talked
of migrating from the capital to a spot opposite
the colony. The slave question would prevent their
establishing themselves within its boundaries; but it
is always a difficult thing for men to abandon their
homes, and in this case, as the power of the Brunei
Government was broken, they no longer feared
oppression. So the colony remained stagnant.</p>

<p>We left Labuan at the end of February, and after
calling in at Sarawak, proceeded to Singapore, where
a budget of news awaited us. The English Government
had appointed Sir James as Special Envoy to proceed
to Siam and Cochin China to form treaties with
those states; at the same time we heard of the
renewal of virulent attacks on the Rajah’s policy by
certain journals and Members of Parliament. After
a pleasant stay of a fortnight, we proceeded to Penang
in the hope that we should all shake off the fever
and ague contracted during our exhausting expeditions.</p>

<p>No man loved nature more than did the Rajah,
and he enjoyed his stay on this lofty hill. He could
ride, or wander among the lovely flowers and plants
of the Governor’s garden, or he could gaze on the
beautiful scenery which unfolded itself around us.
Those six weeks were indeed delightful, and we
often looked back on our quiet sojourn there and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
its refreshing rest. We busied ourselves also in
preparing for our missions to Siam and Annam, to
which I had been appointed secretary.</p>

<p>As the ship of war which was to have taken us
to Siam was soon expected, we would not wait for
the mail steamer, but left Penang in a sailing vessel,
and took seventeen days to reach Singapore, a distance
of only four hundred miles; in our case it was the
greater haste the less speed.</p>

<p>On our arrival in Singapore we found that there
was no vessel ready for us, and we had to wait
weary months there before one was placed at
our disposal. At first we were to have had the
<em>Hastings</em> battleship; then, from some personal reason,
it was decided by Admiral Austen, brother to Jane
Austen, no doubt the ‘William’ of <em>Mansfield Park</em>,
that we were to have H.M.’s steamer <em>Sphynx</em>,
Captain Shadwell. It was quite useless to show
ourselves in Siam without a commanding force, if
we wished to secure a favourable treaty. It was
known that the King of Siam had become hostile
to Europeans, and nothing but fear would work on
his prejudiced mind. Had we appeared off the
Menam River with a strong squadron, our mission
would have been respected.</p>

<p>Early in August we left Singapore for Siam in
the <em>Sphynx</em>, attended by the Company’s steamer
<em>Nemesis</em>, and were soon at our destination. Captain
Brooke and I were sent in to the forts at the mouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
of the river to make arrangements for the Envoy’s
suitable reception. We found the people on shore
in great alarm, and we heard that a heavy boom had
been placed across the river to prevent the steamers
proceeding to the capital. When we had settled
our business we returned to Sir James, and it was
arranged that he should enter the river next morning
in the larger ship. It appeared to a landsman that no
sufficient precautions were taken to mark the deepest
passage, but we trusted to a native pilot, who speedily
ran us on a sandbank. There was no help for it, as
the <em>Sphynx</em> could not be moved, but to be transferred
to the <em>Nemesis</em>, and we then steamed on to
the forts.</p>

<p>The minister charged with foreign affairs had
come down to receive us, so the first meeting between
him and the English Envoy took place at the village
close to the mouth of the river.</p>

<p>It was an amusing scene. The arrogance of this
half-civilised people was extreme, and the minister,
to show his disdain, had the seats intended for the
English Envoy and his suite placed in a position of
marked inferiority. He himself was seated on a
divan, with soft cushions, and surrounded by his
gold betel boxes and tea service, whilst his followers
crouched behind him, and no native approached, except
on his hands and knees, crawling like an insect along
the floor. The minister rose as we entered, and
pointing to some chairs, motioned us to be seated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
but Sir James passed them by. He approached the
minister and shook hands, and sat down opposite to
him; we all followed suit, and did the same, placing
our chairs beside that of our chief. The minister was
breathless with astonishment, but he resumed his seat,
and in a short time recovered his composure, and the
usual routine of questions and answers followed. He
said that the Government had built a house for the
reception of the mission, and that state barges were
being prepared to convey the Envoy and his suite to
the capital. Had the <em>Sphynx</em> been able to enter the
river, we might have insisted on going to the capital
in the <em>Nemesis</em>, but it was settled that we should
proceed in the state barges. Captain Brooke and
I went first to inspect the temporary house allotted
to us, but finding it unsuitable, we accepted the
offer of an English merchant to take his house for
the mission, and use the other for our escort and
for visitors from the ships.</p>

<p>Sir James Brooke was soon satisfied that, under the
then reigning king, success was hopeless, as he had
imbibed a strong prejudice against foreigners through
the unjustifiable conduct of an English merchant,
who had nearly ruined the prospects of our trade
by an attempt to coerce the King into buying a
steamer at four times its value. But what proved
of importance was the confidential intercourse which
took place with Chaufa Mungkut, the legal heir to
the throne. This prince had retired to a monastery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
to avoid the persecution of the King, who was an
illegitimate elder brother.</p>

<p>We readily gathered sufficient information as to
the King’s ill-treatment of various British subjects
to warrant our Government acting against him; but
all our present advances were rejected. I may again
repeat that had we arrived with a strong squadron,
with ships which could have entered the river, and
decided to proceed to Bangkok in a war vessel, there
would have been little opposition to signing a treaty;
but Sir James thought that not much would be
gained by forcing a convention on the Siamese.</p>

<p>Satisfied that nothing could be done, Sir James
sent to the Foreign Minister the value of all presents
received, and we started for the mouth of the river
in the state barges, and soon found ourselves on
board the <em>Sphynx</em> on our way to Singapore. Our
only success had been the discovery that Chaufa
Mungkut was favourable to the English, that he
was an educated prince, who could converse and
correspond in our language, and that when he came
to the throne he would be ready to negotiate.</p>

<p>On our arrival in Singapore we received the particulars
of the debate of July 12, 1850, which had
taken place in the House of Commons concerning our
proceedings against the Seribas pirates. Though Mr
Hume’s motion had been rejected by a great majority,
Sir James justly complained that no minister had
stood up to express their approval of his policy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>However, though these attacks might irritate, they
could not do away with the pleasure afforded by
the good news from Sarawak. The civil war which
had broken out in Sambas between the Chinese gold-working
companies and the Sultan, backed by the
Dutch, had caused about 4000 Chinese agriculturists
to fly from that country and take refuge in Sarawak.
This was a welcome addition, for wherever Chinese
settle there are trade and cultivation, and revenue
follows in their footsteps.</p>

<p>As soon as we could send off the papers connected
with the Siam Mission we proceeded to Sarawak to
find great activity there. The Chinese were spreading
about the town and in the interior, and the Rajah
was soon busy regulating the affairs of the country,
preventing the encroachments of the Chinese on the
Dyaks, to which they were very prone, and visiting
various inland tribes to mark their progress. At one
of those villages we were struck by the intelligent
questions put by several of the Dyaks regarding Siam
and the neighbouring states, and on inquiry we found
that before the advent of the white Rajah the rulers
of the country were accustomed to send them to pull
an oar in the pirate fleets which then cruised throughout
these seas. They had evidently used their eyes to
some purpose whilst thus employed.</p>

<p>A very severe attack of fever and ague interrupted
the Rajah’s activity, and he was at length persuaded
to listen to the voice of his medical man, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
to return to England for the benefit of his health.
But he first visited Labuan, which he found
still making but slow progress; and, though it
appeared at one time that there was really about to
be an influx of Chinese and Malays from the
capital, when it was found that the Governor was
returning to England they made up their minds not
to move until he came back. Some of the latter had
had their prahus towed over by the <em>Nemesis</em>, but they
soon went away again, and the contemplated movement
never took place. The fact was that at that
time they trusted only the English Rajah, and if he
were not in Labuan to protect them they would not
risk exciting the hostility of the Brunei Government.</p>

<p>We soon started again for Sarawak, and on the 17th
of January the Rajah left us for Singapore on his way
to England. His three offices were thus filled—Mr
Scott, afterwards Sir John Scott, was in charge of
the Colony of Labuan; Captain Brooke of the
Principality of Sarawak; and I remained as acting
Commissioner.</p>

<p>I should mention that whilst we were away attending
to Siamese affairs, Mr Balestier, Special Envoy
from the United States, went to Sarawak in a frigate,
the bearer of a letter from the President to Sir James
Brooke, as ruler of the State of Sarawak, proposing
a convention between the two countries. As a
British official, Sir James thought it right to submit
the subject to Lord Palmerston, who found nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
objectionable in the proposed arrangement; however,
amid the heated controversy that was in progress, the
question was unfortunately neglected.</p>

<p>We had all hoped that this visit to Europe was for
health’s sake; but the requisite rest could not be
obtained, as Sir James found himself at once pursued
by the malignity of his enemies—Mr Wise and the
Eastern Archipelago Company—who had found
channels to diffuse their false accusations, as I have
before noticed, in Mr Hume and Mr Cobden. In
the debates in the House, Lord Palmerston spoke out
strongly and clearly, and the majority was absolutely
crushing; but Joseph Hume did not know when he
was beaten, and brought the question again and again
before Parliament.</p>

<p>Sir James now turned on his enemies; dragged the
Eastern Archipelago Company into court, and the
case ended by it being declared that ‘The directors
had signed a false certificate, knowing it to be false.’
This was in regard to their capital. Their charter
was therefore abrogated and the seal torn off that
document. These directors must have bitterly regretted
having joined Wise in his campaign against
the Rajah.</p>

<p>Sir James was also busy in answering hostile attacks,
and his letters addressed to Mr Drummond, M.P.,
on Mr Hume’s assertions, were considered masterly
compositions, completely establishing his case—the
view entertained by all reasonable men. Mr Sidney<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
Herbert also determined to break a lance with the
Rajah, but soon repented of his temerity and retired
discomfited from the field. Sir James had this advantage
over his adversaries, that his conduct in
Borneo had been marked by so much courage, and
was so straightforward and honourable, that they
could find no weak point in his armour.</p>

<p>A great dinner was given to Sir James Brooke at
the London Tavern, on the 30th April 1852, attended
by over two hundred men of distinction, and among
the many speeches that were made, one by Baron
Alderson was especially remarkable. He observed,
‘that the greatest benefactors of the human race have
been most abused in their own lifetime,’ but notwithstanding
this, ‘he promised him the approbation
of his own conscience, the approbation of all good
and reasonable men, and of Almighty God, who does
justice and who will reward.’</p>

<p>The speech of the evening, however, was that of
the guest. Those who had never heard him before
were surprised and delighted. His noble presence, his
refined manner, the charm of his voice, quite captivated
them, whilst his words carried conviction. He
wound up by saying, ‘Do not disgrace your public
servants by inquiries generated in the fogs of base
suspicions; for, remember, a wrong done is like a
wound received—the scar is ineffaceable. It may be
covered by glittering decorations, but there it remains
to the end.’ Prophetic words!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>Lord Derby’s Government was now in office, and
Lord Malmesbury settled with Sir James Brooke that
he should be appointed Her Majesty’s representative
in the Further East, to enable him to negotiate
treaties with foreign powers. He was to begin with
Siam and Cochin China. A General Election, however,
took place in the autumn of 1852, which sealed
the fate of the Conservative Ministry. Sir James had
already been named Envoy to Siam, and would have
proceeded at once to that country by the special wish
of Chaufa Mungkut, the new king, when the Mission
was suddenly and unexpectedly put off, owing to His
Majesty’s desire to have further time to complete the
elaborate funeral ceremonies required by custom for
his brother, the late king. Ever since our mission to
Siam in 1850, Chaufa Mungkut had kept up a private
correspondence with the Rajah of Sarawak, in whose
doings he showed great interest.</p>

<p>So closed the year 1852, and on the 1st January
1853 appeared the list of the new ministers—the
Coalition Ministry of Lord Aberdeen. ‘England
loves not coalitions,’ said D’Israeli; and we certainly
did not love this one. Probably to strengthen their
parliamentary majority, and yielding to the influence
of Mr Cobden, the new Government decided to grant
Mr Hume’s demand and issue a Commission to inquire
into the conduct of Sir James Brooke. Sir
James himself had always courted inquiry, and therefore
the Ministry might have communicated their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
intention to him before he left England, which he
had decided to do during the first week in April.
But instead of consulting with him, they tried to
keep the whole affair dark, and it was only accidentally
that Sir James heard of it. I never
could understand how a frank, loyal man like Lord
Clarendon could lend himself to such proceedings, but
I suppose he was overruled by Lord Aberdeen and
Mr Sidney Herbert.</p>

<p>Finding that their determination to issue a Commission
of Inquiry could no longer be concealed from Sir
James Brooke, they wrote to him officially on the subject,
and stated that they would call on the Governor-General
of India to choose Commissioners. They
further assured Sir James that ‘the inquiry should
be full, fair and complete.’ But the whole transaction
had been so underhand, so humiliating to him
personally, so derogatory to him as ruler of Sarawak,
that he felt it bitterly, and he closed his despatch to
Lord Clarendon, April 4, 1853, the day he left
England, with these words: ‘It is with sorrow unmixed
with anger that I leave the world to judge the
services I have rendered and the treatment I have
received.’</p>

<p>On Sir James Brooke’s arrival in Singapore he
found that while the Government had been reticent
with him, they had been confidential with Mr Hume,
who repaid that confidence by divulging all the details
of the proposed Commission to the editor of a hostile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
paper in Singapore. This personage made the most
of it, and indulged in violent tirades, in which he
gloated over the disgrace which had fallen upon Sir
James. But this abuse affected none of the Rajah’s
friends, who were the flower of Singapore society.</p>

<p>No ships of war were now at his disposal, and I
doubt whether in his then state of mind he would
have accepted their services. He returned to Sarawak
in a small merchant brig, the <em>Weraff</em>, commanded by
a cheerful little Frenchman.</p>

<p>His reception in his adopted country might have
consoled him for the injustice of his own Government,
for never had he received a more sincere welcome.
The whole population was astir, and the hill on which
Government House stood, as well as the house itself,
was crammed with his joyous subjects; but he soon
complained of being tired. We noticed that the
Rajah’s face looked swollen, and I heard a native say
he had <em>purunasi</em>, but none of us understood the word,
which meant smallpox in the language of the north.
Fever came on, and I used to sit for hours with him.
At last it was manifest to everyone that it was smallpox.
No sooner did he hear this than he insisted that
all those who had not suffered from that disease should
leave the room, and he chose his attendants among the
Malays and submitted to native treatment. His cousin,
Arthur Crookshank, watched over him, and all would
have braved the danger of contagion, but he would
have none of us with him. A Mr Horsburgh, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
missionary, who thought he had passed through
the ordeal, joined those who were nursing him.</p>

<p>By the Rajah’s express order our hill was tabooed,
and all were forbidden to approach for fear the
disease might spread; but this rule was afterwards
relaxed in favour of those who had already suffered
from it, and as most of the Malays were in that case,
they came every day to inquire. There was no
doubt of the intense feeling of anxiety that oppressed
the people. There were prayers in the mosques, votive
offerings by Klings and Chinese, and as for the Dyaks,
they were in despair. However, the crisis passed, and
then the Rajah was overwhelmed with presents.
Scented water was brought for his bath; delicate
dishes, to tempt his appetite, came from the native
ladies; and the rejoicing was true and heartfelt. We
all remained near the Rajah, and as soon as we were
permitted eagerly joined in nursing him. The attack
had been most severe, and it would have been difficult
for a casual acquaintance to have recognised the same
man in our chief, who had just escaped from the very
jaws of death.</p>

<p>As soon as the Rajah was sufficiently recovered, he
decided to visit the capital. The Sultan Omar Ali was
dead, and Pangeran Mumein had been chosen to fill
that office, although he did not belong to the royal
family. We started in the same little merchant brig
<em>Weeraff</em>, and were soon at the capital. The Rajah
knew that every kind of intrigue had been going on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
during his long absence. The Eastern Archipelago
Company had sent their agent to try and induce the
late Sultan to complain of the conduct of Her
Majesty’s Commissioner; and the Ex-Lieutenant-Governor
of Labuan had also written to the Brunei
Government to tell them of the Commission, and
to insinuate that Sir James was no longer the powerful
personage that he had been. The Queen had
decided to inquire into his conduct; so now was the
time to act. However, these intrigues completely
failed.</p>

<p>The Rajah had not been a week in the capital
when his influence was as completely re-established
as when he had an admiral and a squadron at his
back. The grant of Sarawak was confirmed, and a
new deed was made out, giving him the government
of the rivers, as far as the Rejang, on the
payment of £1000 a year. Not even Mr Hume
could say that he obtained these concessions by the
use of force.</p>

<p>While we were in Brunei, we lodged in the Sultan’s
palace, and were fed from the royal kitchen; we
found the cuisine excellent. The Sultan and
pangerans were constant visitors, and we enjoyed
our stay among them. Not only did the Brunei
Government confirm public grants, but they handed
over to the Rajah the originals of the letters addressed
to them by Mr Napier and others, showing how
active his enemies had been as soon as it was known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
that a Commission of Inquiry had been granted by
our vacillating ministers.</p>

<p>Nothing could better illustrate the conduct and
character of the Rajah than the results of this visit.
Here was this man, under the ban of the British
Government, exposed to every insult from a reptile
press—fortunately among English papers a very small
minority—and apparently in deep disgrace. Yet in
his own adopted country he was respected, loved
and trusted beyond any other man by all races and
creeds.</p>

<p>Upon our return to Sarawak we heard of Lord
Clarendon’s instructions to the Commission which
was to inquire into Sir James Brooke’s conduct and
position. As I propose to devote a few pages to it
later on, I need not dwell upon them now.</p>

<p>The Rajah had long meditated a scheme to bring
the Land Dyaks of Sarawak, Samarahan and Sadong
under the direct rule of the Government. Up to the
year 1853 the Dyak tribes had been apportioned
among the three Datus or Malay chiefs, which was
the immemorial custom; but it was found in practice
to work badly, particularly in the hands of the Datu
Patingi. He was an ambitious man, fond of parade,
and kept up two large establishments for his principal
wives. To support the expense, he not only exacted
all that was legally due to him, but carried on a
system of forced trade, preventing the Dyaks from
buying, except of him and his agents—a truck trade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
on an extended system and in its worst form.
The complaints which reached headquarters were
numerous. After he had married his daughter to one
of the Arab adventurers on the coast, who pretended
to be a descendant of the Prophet, his extortions knew
no bounds.</p>

<p>The Rajah determined to pay the Datus fixed
salaries, fifty per cent. beyond their legal dues, and to
insist on the trade with the Dyaks being as free in
practice as it was in theory. The Malay chiefs were
pleased with the arrangement; but gradually the old
abuses of forced trade were reintroduced by the
Patingi, and the Rajah was often obliged to interfere
to protect the Dyaks.</p>

<p>The Patingi became dissatisfied when he found his
evil courses checked, and began to conspire against his
benefactor, who had saved his life after the civil war
was ended; and when he heard that a Commission had
been appointed by the English Government to try the
Rajah, he became very active in his intrigues, and
proposed to the other chiefs to expel the English from
Sarawak. None joined him, and though they kept a
watch on his proceedings, they never breathed a word
of the nascent conspiracy either to the Rajah or to any
of his officers. When the whole executive Government,
English as well as Malay, were away on an expedition,
a brave young chief, Abong Patah, came to me (I was
then Her Majesty’s acting Commissioner) and revealed
all the details of the plot. I instantly sent off the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
news to the Rajah, who did not doubt its truth for
a moment. He had himself observed very suspicious
movements of the Patingi’s armed vessels, and had also
noticed that whenever that chief anchored near the
English war prahu, where all the Rajah’s officers
assembled every evening, the other chiefs would,
apparently by accident, allow their prahus to drop
alongside. The Rajah communicated the discovery
to some of his most trustworthy followers, both
English and Malay, but left the Patingi in ignorance,
though judicious precautions were taken to frustrate
his machinations.</p>

<p>As soon, however, as the Rajah returned to the
capital, he summoned a meeting of all the chiefs and
principal men of the country, and in open court
accused the Patingi of all his crimes and misdemeanours.
He told him that on account of the
respect he had for his family he would not try him
for high treason; but that all his arms and ammunition
must be handed over to abide the decision of
the Government. The Patingi was too surprised to
deny his guilt; in fact, he knew that every chief present
was aware of his criminal intentions. It ended by his
being permitted to make the pilgrimage to Mecca.
The Rajah’s leniency, though judging by subsequent
events misplaced, was so natural that it met with
general approval, except among the more far-seeing of
the Malays, who predicted that this ungrateful chief
would yet do the English an ill turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>The Rajah then tried an experiment, of which
some doubted the wisdom, of supplying the place of
the deposed Datu by appointing the head of the
Mohammedan priesthood in Sarawak to become the
third ruling Malay chief. He was brother to the
Datu Bandhar—a quiet, honest, good Malay. How
well the Rajah judged has been shown by the
subsequent history of Sarawak. The Datu Imaum has
always proved the mainstay of the English in all their
troubles and difficulties; and, although much over
eighty, I heard of his being well and active until quite
recently.</p>

<p>The Rajah had intended to adopt no warlike measures
against the pirate Dyaks, headed by the notorious chief
Rentab, until the Commission was over, but after
waiting fifteen months, and finding no signs of its
assembling, he determined to lead an expedition
against them. Previous attempts by his officers had
failed, but this expedition was so well organised
that its success was assured.</p>

<p>Eight thousand Malays and Dyaks answered to the
summons of their chief, whilst an expedition of fifteen
hundred men threatened the enemy in the interior
of the Rejang, and well-armed war prahus anchored
in the Seribas. We pushed up the great Batang
Lupar river, then ascended the Sakarang as far as
our big war boats would go, built a fort for their
protection, left a garrison—and there the Rajah was
persuaded to remain, as his state of health did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
permit him to expose himself to the further hardships
of the advance.</p>

<p>We proceeded in our light boats, or pushed through
the jungle. I never saw such a go-as-you-please expedition.
An enterprising enemy might have cut us off
as we scattered through the woods, but fortunately they
were over-awed by the reports of our numbers and of
our arms. Captain Brooke, who was in command, saw
the danger of this method of advance, and decided to
continue the expedition in boats. Our people had
found a large number of these in the jungle, hidden
there by the enemy, so we soon had enough for the
Malays. At first most of the Dyaks preferred to
walk, but gradually they secured sufficient canoes to
enable all to advance by the river.</p>

<p>The object of the expedition was to attack Sungei
Lang—a large fortified village held by Rentab and his
followers, and, if possible, a stronghold he had constructed
on the summit of the Sadok Mountain.
After much skirmishing and firing, the fort was
gallantly stormed, and before sunset was completely
in our hands. And glad we were that there had
been no delay, as scarcely were we housed, when a
violent tempest burst, that would have effectually
drenched us had we remained in the open. We
stayed in this village whilst our men were employed
punishing the followers of Rentab; but no attempt
was made to attack his fortified post on the summit of
the Sadok mountain. Natives seldom care to continue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
a campaign after its announced object has been
accomplished, and our object was to take Sungei
Lang. Sadok defied successive expeditions for eight
years more. The Sakarang river was now in flood, so
that on our return we passed over all natural obstructions
in safety. We were heartily received by the
Rajah and congratulated on our success, as the storming
of Rentab’s stronghold was no mean achievement
with only native followers.</p>

<p>On our arrival at Sarawak we had news of the
Commissioners being expected at Singapore, and
H.M.’s. brig <em>Lily</em> arrived to convey Sir James Brooke
and his followers to our Straits Settlements, but the
Rajah had to go alone, as Grant, Brereton and myself
were down with fever, the result of over-exposure
to sun and rain and the cold watches of the night.
Brereton did not recover, and in him the Rajah lost a
most efficient and devoted officer.</p>

<p>No one now cares for the Commission sent to
inquire into the position and conduct of Sir James
Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak, and Commissioner and
Consul-General in Borneo; but as its results were so
disastrous I must devote a few pages to it.</p>

<p>As I have before mentioned—and here I am obliged
to repeat some observations I have previously made—when
Sir James Brooke found that his agent in
England, Mr Wise, was trying to involve him in
schemes which he considered doubtful, he endeavoured
to check him, and used strong language about his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
projects, looking upon them as designs to defraud the
public by false representations. Mr Wise accidentally
came to know the energetic expressions used by his
employer, and decided to have his revenge, but he
held his hand until the right moment had arrived.
He still continued to press Sir James to join his
gigantic companies, but failed in his attempts.
Other events occurred which excited him still more,
such as the Rajah’s handing over to the British
Government, instead of directly to himself, the grant
of the coal seams in certain portions of the Sultan’s
dominions which Sir James had received whilst Her
Majesty’s Agent. At length, when his employer
called upon him to produce his accounts, as a very
large balance was due to him, Mr Wise began to
denounce him publicly. The Farquhar expedition
furnished him with the opportunity, and he now
posed as a humanitarian, and furnished certain
members of the press with garbled information.
We may imagine how unscrupulous he was when
Lord Clarendon stated, ‘It had been detected in the
Foreign Office that Mr Wise’s “<cite>Papers printed for
use in the Government Offices</cite>” could not be relied
on, and that some were “simple forgeries.”’</p>

<p>Mr Wise, however, managed, as I have said, to
persuade Mr Joseph Hume to enter into his projects,
who found an ally in Mr Cobden, and they both
commenced a campaign in the House of Commons
against the Rajah. This continued until the Coalition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
Ministry, under Lord Aberdeen, came into power
in 1853. To secure the Parliamentary support of the
Free Trade party, Lord Aberdeen weakly consented to
issue a Commission on the lines suggested by Mr
Hume, Sir James’s vindictive adversary.</p>

<p>The Commission might have been issued with the
concurrence of both parties, as Sir James was anxious
for a full inquiry; but the Government, whilst informing
Mr Hume of their intention to accede to his
demand, thought it becoming to keep Sir James
ignorant of it, and he found it out by accident.</p>

<p>Forty-five years have passed since this event
occurred, and yet I cannot write of it without a flush
of indignation. Mr Gladstone made this observation:
‘His (Sir James’s) language respecting Mr Hume
and Mr Cobden, two men of the very highest integrity
... is for the most part quite unjustifiable.’
Mr Hume’s integrity, by his own confession, was not
above suspicion, and Mr Cobden may be judged by
the following extract: ‘Sir James Brooke seized
on a territory as large as Yorkshire, and then drove
out the natives, and subsequently sent for our fleet
and men to massacre them.’ The insolence and
ignorance displayed in the latter statement, as I
have elsewhere observed, are about equal.</p>

<p>Grant and I soon followed the Rajah to Singapore,
and found the Commission sitting. It was composed
of Mr Prinsep and Mr Devereux, the former suffering
from a malady which was beginning to show itself at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
intervals, and quite incapable of conducting the
inquiry with dignity; the latter everything which
could be desired—a man of marked ability, impartial
and painstaking.</p>

<p>When the Commission opened its sittings, only
two complainants came forward—the ex-Lieutenant-Governor
of Labuan, and an editor of a newspaper.
Both of these were informed that their cases were
beyond the scope of the Commission. As, however,
above fifty inhabitants of Singapore had signed an
address to Mr Hume, supporting his demand for an
inquiry into the character of the tribes of Seribas and
Sakarang, the Commissioners naturally thought that
they would be prepared with some evidence of their
assertion that these tribes were not piratical, and that
they had been massacred under false pretences; but
all the memorialists who were called by the Commissioners
denied having any knowledge on the subject,
and many had signed under the impression that they
were aiding the cause of Sir James Brooke. The
Commissioners waited day after day for hostile witnesses,
but none came.</p>

<p>While we were all waiting for that testimony which
was not forthcoming, a gentleman who was sitting
next me said, ‘I should like to give evidence.’ I
mentioned his wish to the Commissioners. He was
then called forward, and stated that his name was
Boudriot; that he was in the Civil Service of the
Dutch Government; that he had resided four and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
a half years in Borneo. He knew of the Seribas and
Sakarang Dyaks; he had always known them as pirates,
killing and murdering all along the coast. They came
down in large, armed boats, holding each a crew of
from eighty to ninety, killing the men they met and
carrying off the women and children as slaves. In
one excursion they killed about four hundred men.
This happened in the Dutch possessions. They had
ravaged the Dutch settlements; probably the recorded
instances would number one hundred. ‘As
every one in Borneo knows them (as pirates), I am
surprised that anyone should question their existence.’</p>

<p>When it is remembered that this evidence was
given unsolicited by a high and experienced Dutch
official, who, on his way home on furlough, happened
to be passing through Singapore, and that the Netherlands
Government had shown itself exceedingly jealous
of Sir James Brooke’s position in Borneo, no further
evidence would seem to have been required. Mr
Boudriot’s coming forward to bear testimony in
favour of a political opponent was as honourable to
the Dutch official as to his Government, which he
knew would not object to his testifying in favour of
the truth.</p>

<p>The witnesses called by the hostile memorialists
came to curse, but remained to bless. Reluctant as they
were to tell all they knew, enough was dragged out
of them to show the true character of the Seribas and
Sakarang Dyaks. One was the dismissed Lieutenant-Governor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
of Labuan, the second a man of German
extraction, who had lived on Sir James Brooke’s
bounty for many years, and the third the banished
Patingi of Sarawak; but he showed no animus against
Sir James Brooke. In point of fact, they did not
prove hostile witnesses, as the testimony of the first two,
apart from the feeling displayed, was quite satisfactory.
Mr Devereux and Mr Prinsep observe in their reports
that the memorialists or their agent did what they could
to prevent the native witnesses from appearing, but
enough came forward to prove to both Commissioners
the piratical character of these Dyaks, and Mr
Devereux pointedly remarks that no undue severity
was exercised.</p>

<p>In spite of the instructions to the Commissioners,
which were remarkable for their hostile spirit,
these gentlemen reported favourably on all those points
on which the public felt any interest; the Seribas
and Sakarang Dyaks were declared pirates, and it
was found and placed on record that Sir James had
not been a trader whilst in the service of the
Crown. On matters of opinion they differed, and
did not accept Sir James’s claim of the complete
independence of Sarawak <em>de jure</em>, though it was so
<em>de facto</em>. The other questions were of no practical
importance.</p>

<p>Although we did not receive the report of the
Commissioners until the end of the following year,
I may now notice the findings, and then close this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
unfortunate story of ministerial weakness and bad
faith.</p>

<p>There were four heads of inquiry.</p>

<p>First—Whether the position of Sir James Brooke at
Sarawak was compatible with his duties as Commissioner
and Consul-General?</p>

<p>It was decided to be incompatible; but Mr Devereux
added, ‘It may be stated as regards the past that the
junction of the two positions has had beneficial results.’
As the British Government had appointed Sir James
to the post without any solicitation on his part,
with a full knowledge of his position at Sarawak, any
blame would be theirs and not his. As, however, he
had resigned his posts, this point had only an academic
interest.</p>

<p>Second—Whether the interests of Sir James Brooke
as a holder of territory, and as a trader in the produce
of that territory, were compatible?</p>

<p>It was found that Sir James was not a trader in the
true sense of the term any more than the Governor-General
of India.</p>

<p>Third—Personal complaints against Sir James
Brooke.</p>

<p>Two were made, but not entertained by the
Commissioners.</p>

<p>Fourth—What were the relations of Sir James
Brooke with and towards the native tribes on the
north-west coast of Borneo, with a view to ascertain
whether it was necessary that he should be entrusted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
with a discretion to determine which of these tribes
were piratical, or, taking into account the recent
operations on the coast, to call for the aid of Her
Majesty’s forces for the punishment of such tribes.</p>

<p>Mr Devereux remarked, ‘It appears most desirable
that there should be an authority empowered to call
for the aid of Her Majesty’s naval forces for the
suppression of piracy.’</p>

<p>‘I have already declared my opinion that the
Seribas and Sakarang Dyaks are piratical tribes; it
was therefore most just and expedient, and in conformity
with the obligations of treaty, that punishment
should be inflicted on them with the view
to the suppression of their atrocious outrages. The
exact measure of punishment which should have been
inflicted is a question which does not belong to me to
decide, but I may say that it was essential that the
thing should be done, and done effectually. So far as
regards the loss of life inflicted on them, there does
not appear any reasonable ground for sympathy for a
race of indiscriminate murderers.’</p>

<p>I have thus shortly summed up the proceedings
and findings of the Commission. I have not thought
it necessary to enter into any details, as the questions
are dead, and no one feels any interest in the
mendacious statements of a W. N. or a Chameroozow.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
The Seribas and Sakarang Dyaks are now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
some of the best subjects of Sarawak, so faithful that
they are enlisted as soldiers and garrison the principal
forts.</p>

<p>The Commission closed, and we returned to
Sarawak towards the end of November with a feeling
of great relief. As a ship of war had fetched the
Rajah from Sarawak, so a ship of war took him back,
and Captain Blaine of H.M.S. <em>Rapid</em> showed him
every courtesy, and treated him officially as a prince
in his own country.</p>

<p>Our next six months were passed quietly. The
Rajah was anxious about the report of the Commission,
but he felt that in all essential points it must be in his
favour. During this peaceful time he busied himself
with the interior affairs of the country, or retired for
recreation to his charming cottage among the hills.</p>

<p>No one who had not lived in close intimacy with
the Rajah could form any idea of the charm of his
society. His conversation was always attractive,
whether he was treating of political or religious questions,
and when he was in good spirits, his ordinary
talk was enlivened by playful humour. His affectionate
disposition endeared him to all, and although subsequently
differences arose with some of his followers and
relatives, no one among them but preserved a kindly
feeling towards their old chief. Our visits to the
hill cottage left so pleasant an impression on my
mind that they can never be forgotten.</p>

<p>At this time, on the advice of Earl Grey, the Rajah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
created a ‘Council of Sarawak,’ the first members of
which were himself and his two nephews, to represent
the English element, and four Malay chiefs to represent
the native inhabitants of Sarawak. It proved
a most useful measure, and the native members showed
themselves highly efficient.</p>

<p>In October 1855 Captain Brooke and Charles
Grant left us for a visit home, and Arthur
Crookshank was still absent in England, so that
much work fell on the Rajah. We had scarcely
settled down to a quiet life when we were disturbed
by the arrival of despatches from Lord Clarendon,
enclosing the Blue Book containing all the documents
relating to the Commission, and expressing a cold
approval of Sir James Brooke’s conduct. I also
received despatches, one appointing me Consul-General
in Borneo, and the other containing an
Order in Council directing me to send to the
nearest English colony all British subjects accused
of crimes and misdemeanours within the Sultan’s
dominions, including Sarawak. The absurdity of
such an Order in Council appears never to have struck
the Foreign Office. In the first place, it was in
direct opposition to our Treaty with the Brunei
Government; secondly, the sending for trial to
Singapore of a prisoner and all the witnesses would
have entailed an expenditure of hundreds of pounds,
possibly on account of a thief who had stolen the
value of a shilling. It was no difficult matter to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
point out to our Government that it was wiser to let
well alone; that the courts of Sarawak had always
exercised jurisdiction over British subjects, and that
no complaints of injustice had ever been made. I
consequently suggested that the system then at work
should be continued.</p>

<p>Any other solution would have been felt to be
intolerable, both by the Rajah and by the native
chiefs. Fortunately wise counsels prevailed in
England, and the proposed arrangement, which was
founded on ignorance, was reversed. I was
authorised to inform the Sarawak Council that Her
Majesty’s Government had no desire whatever to
interfere with them, or to prevent them choosing
what form of government they pleased; and I added
that the British Government accepted the plan
suggested for settling the question of jurisdiction.
In fact, the Sarawak courts were authorised to
continue to try British subjects as before.</p>

<p>The Rajah was deeply mortified by Lord Clarendon’s
despatches. After all the promises the latter
had made to the late Lord Ellesmere, that if the
Commission reported in Sir James Brooke’s favour the
Government would be prepared to do all that he
desired, to receive a bare statement of approval of his
conduct was very disheartening. After all the mischief
which arose from the mere appointment of
the Commission, the loss of prestige which produced
the Patingi’s abortive plot, and later on the Chinese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
insurrection, such treatment was inexplicable to him.
He was sore and indignant. He only asked for a
steamer to be placed on the coast to check piracy.
Even this was refused.</p>

<p>However, when Lord Clarendon agreed to recognise
the jurisdiction of the Sarawak courts, the
Rajah was greatly mollified. He wrote, ‘The Government
has done far more than I expected, and our
misunderstanding is at an end.’ The strong expressions
of good-will contained in the same despatch had
a very tranquillising effect upon him, and he almost
thought he had forgiven the Government their great
injustice.</p>

<p>As the British Government would not allow me to
ask for an <em>exequatur</em> from the Sarawak authorities, I
left Kuching for Brunei in August 1856. It was
severing very precious ties. Before I sailed, Arthur
Crookshank had returned to his post and brought
with him, as his bride, a ‘vision of beauty,’ to use the
Rajah’s own phrase.</p>

<p>During this year some capitalists in London formed
the Borneo Company, to develop the resources of the
territories under Sarawak rule. Coal had been discovered
in various places, and there were valuable
products to be collected, principally sago, gutta-percha
and india-rubber; there was also the produce of the
antimony mines, and subsequently cinnabar, or the
metal containing quicksilver.</p>

<p>A short time before Mr Macdougall, the head of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
the Borneo Mission, had been raised in rank, and was
named Bishop of Labuan and Sarawak.</p>

<p>As slight returns of fever and ague had weakened
the Rajah, he accepted Sir William Hoste’s offer of a
passage to Singapore in H.M.S. <em>Spartan</em>, where he
passed a few months recruiting his health. Towards
the end of January 1857 he returned to Sarawak in
the <em>Sir James Brooke</em>, a steamer sent out by the
Borneo Company to aid in their commercial work.
The Rajah found the country greatly excited by
persistent rumours of a Chinese conspiracy. His
valuable officer, Mr Arthur Crookshank, fully believed
in the hostile intentions of the Chinese Kungsi or
Gold Working Company, and had therefore manned
the forts with sufficient garrisons. But Sir James
Brooke, having summoned the Chinese chiefs before
him, and punished them for their illegal acts, was
satisfied with their submission, and believed they
would not be so insensate as to endeavour to carry
out their previous threats. He therefore dismissed
the extra men from the forts, and wrote to me on
February 14th, ‘Congratulate me on being free
from all my troubles.’</p>

<p class="no-indent">Chinese colonists are the mainstay of every country
in the Further East; but they carry with them an
institution which may have its value in ill-governed
countries, but which in our colonies is an unmitigated
evil. I refer to their secret societies. A
secret society is ostensibly instituted under the form
of a benevolent association, but actually its members
are banded together to obey no laws but their own, to
carry out the behests of their leaders without question,
and to afford protection to each other under all
circumstances. If a member of the secret society
commit a crime he is to be protected or hidden
away; if he be taken by the police, the society is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
bound to secure him the ablest legal assistance, furnish
as many false witnesses as may be required, and if he
be convicted, pay his fine, or do all in its power
to alleviate the discomforts of a prison. Therefore,
flogging is the most deterrent form of punishment, as
it cannot be shared. Should the society suspect any
member of revealing its secrets, or from any cause
desire to be rid of an obnoxious person, it condemns
the individual to death, and sentence is carried out by
its members, who, through fear of the last penalty,
always obey their oath. On these occasions the
mark of the society is put on the victim to show who
has ordered the deed. In our colonies we have not
been altogether successful in putting down these
pernicious associations.</p>

<p>For many years the Chinese living in Kuching, the
capital of Sarawak, had attempted to form secret
societies, but the Rajah’s vigorous hand had crushed
every attempt, and it appeared as if success had attended
his policy. This was the case so far as the Chinese of
the capital were concerned; but in the interior, among
the gold workers, the Kungsi performed the functions
of a secret society, and its chiefs carried on extensive
correspondence with their fellow-countrymen in
Sambas and Pontianak, the neighbouring Dutch
possessions, and with the Tien-Ti-Hué (Heaven and
Earth Secret Society) in Singapore.</p>

<p>When Mr Fox and I made a long tour, in July 1856,
among the Chinese settlements of the interior, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
became convinced that opium smuggling was being
carried on to a great extent, as however numerous
might be the newcomers, the revenue from that
source had a tendency to decrease.</p>

<p>At last it was discovered that opium was sent from
Singapore to the Natuna Islands, and from thence
it was smuggled into Sarawak and the Dutch possessions
of Sambas and Pontianak. It was proved
that the Kungsi had been engaged in this contraband
trade, and it was fined £150, a very trifling amount,
considering the thousands it had gained by defrauding
the revenue, and measures were immediately
taken to suppress the traffic. This, and the
punishment of three of its members for a gross
assault on another Chinaman, were the only grounds
of complaint which could be alleged against the
Sarawak Government.</p>

<p>But these trivial cases were not the real cause of
the Chinese insurrection in Sarawak. Before that
date all the Celestials in the East had been greatly
excited by the announcement that the English had retired
from before Canton, and that the Viceroy of the
province had offered a reward of £25 for every Englishman
slain. The news had been greatly exaggerated. It
was said we had been utterly defeated by the Chinese
forces, and now was the time, the Gold Company
thought, to expel the English from Sarawak and
assume the government themselves. The secret
societies were everywhere in great excitement, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
the Tien-Ti-Hué sent emissaries over from Singapore
and Malacca to incite the gold workers to rebellion,
and used the subtle, but unfortunately cogent argument,
that not only were the English crushed at Canton,
but that the British Government was so discontented
with the Rajah that it would not interfere,
if the Kungsi only destroyed him and his officers,
and did not meddle with private English interests
or obstruct trade. Here we see another disastrous
effect of the Commission.</p>

<p>It was also currently reported that the Sultan of
Sambas and his Malay nobles offered every encouragement
to the enterprise; and the Chinese listened
much to their advice, as these noblemen can speak to
the Celestials in their own language, and are themselves
greatly imbued with Chinese ideas. To explain this
curious state of things, it may be mentioned that the
children of these nobles are always nursed by girls
chosen from among the healthiest of the daughters
of the Chinese gold workers. Further, about that
time there was a very active intercourse carried
on between the Malay nobles of Sambas and
Pangeran Makota, the Rajah’s old enemy and
the Sultan of Brunei’s favourite minister, and the
latter was constantly closeted with an emissary
of the Tien-Ti-Hué of Singapore, to whom I am
about to refer.</p>

<p>To show that this was not a mere conjecture
I may state that on the 14th of February 1857,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
four days before the insurrection in Sarawak, a
Chinese named Achang, who had arrived at Brunei
from Singapore a few days previously, and had a
year before been expelled from Sarawak for joining
a secret society, came to my house to try and induce
my four Chinese servants to enter the Hué, adding
as a sufficient reason that the Gold Company of
Sarawak would by that time have killed all the white
men in that country.</p>

<p>At Bau, the chief town of the Chinese in Sarawak,
the secretary of the Kungsi showed a letter from the
Straits Branch of the Tien-Ti-Hué to a Malay
trader named Jeludin, urging them to act against
the foreigner. I mention these facts to show the
extraordinary ramifications of these secret societies,
which in every country where they exist are the
source of endless trouble and disorder.</p>

<p>During the month of November 1856 rumours
were abroad that the Chinese Gold Company intended
to surprise the small stockades which constituted the
only defences of the town of Kuching, and which,
as no enemy was suspected to exist in the country,
were seldom guarded by more than four men each.
Mr Crookshank, who was then administering the
government, took the precaution (as has been stated)
to man them with a sufficient garrison, for it was
said that during one of their periodical religious feasts
several hundred men were to collect quietly, and
make a rush for the arsenal. On the Rajah’s return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
from Singapore he instituted some inquiries into the
affair, but could obtain no further information than such
as vague rumour afforded. He consequently reduced
the garrisons, after punishing the Chinese chiefs;
but such experienced officers as Mr Crookshank and
the chief constable, Mr Middleton, were not satisfied,
feeling that there was mischief in the air; and Mr
Charles Johnson wrote to me that if their high tone
was not lowered the Chinese would certainly do the
country a mischief.</p>

<p>I was sitting one day reading in my verandah, in
the Consulate at Brunei, when a Malay hastily entered
and said, ‘I have just arrived from Singapore.’ Whilst
detained by very light winds we approached a
schooner coming from Sarawak, and one of the crew
called out to us, “The Chinese have risen against
the Rajah and killed all the white men.” He knew
no more. This, coupled with what I had previously
heard of the conversations of the Hué leader, made
me feel very uncomfortable. I would have left for
Sarawak at once, but there was no means of direct
communication. In a few days a hurried note
from a friend who had escaped to Singapore told
me part of the catastrophe, but it was not for two
months that I had the full particulars in a letter
from the Rajah himself.</p>

<p>It appears that when the Kungsi saw their professions
of loyalty accepted, they began to prepare
for hostile operations, and on the morning of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
18th of February 1857 the chiefs assembled about
six hundred of their followers at Bau, their most
important station, and placing all the available
weapons in their hands, marched them down to
their principal wharf at Tundong, where a
squadron of their large cargo boats was collected.
It is now known that until they actually began to
descend the river none but the heads of the movement
were aware of its true object, so well had the secret
been kept. To account for the preparations, it was
given out that an attack was meditated on a Dyak
village in Sambas, whose fighting men had in reality
killed some Chinese.</p>

<p>During their slow passage down the river, a Malay,
who was accustomed to trade with the Chinese, overtook
them in a canoe, and actually induced them to permit
him to pass under the plea that his wife and children
lived in a place called Batu Kawa, eight miles above
the town, and would be frightened if they heard so many
men passing, and he was not there to reassure them.
Instead of returning home, he pulled down as fast as
he could till he reached the town of Kuching, and
going straight to his relative, a Malay trader of the
name of Gapur, a trustworthy and brave man, told
him what he had seen; but Gapur said, ‘Don’t go
and tell the chiefs or the Rajah such a tissue of
absurdities;’ yet he went himself over to the Datu
Bandhar and informed him. The chiefs answer
was, ‘The Rajah is unwell; we have heard similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
reports for the last twenty years; don’t go and
bother him about it. In the morning I will tell
him what your relative says.’ This great security
was caused by the universal belief that the Chinese
could not commit so egregious a folly as to attempt
to seize the Government of the country, considering
that, with agriculturists included, they did not number
above four thousand, while at that time the Malays
and Dyaks within the Sarawak territory amounted
to two hundred thousand at least. It was strange,
however, and unpardonably negligent on the part of
the Datu Bandhar not to have sent a fast boat up
the river to ascertain what was really going on.
Had he done so, the town and numerous lives would
have been saved, and punishment would only have
fallen on the guilty.</p>

<p>Shortly after midnight the squadron of Chinese
barges pulled silently through the capital, and dividing
into two bodies, the smaller entered a creek, called
Sungei Bedil, just above the Rajah’s house, while the
larger party continued its course to the landing-place
of the fort, and sent out strong detachments to surprise
the houses of Mr Crookshank, the magistrate, and Mr
Middleton, the head constable, and a large force was
told off to attack the stockades. Unaccountable as
it may appear, none of these parties were noticed, so
profound was the security felt; and everyone slept.</p>

<p>The Government House was situated on a little
grassy hill, surrounded by small, neat cottages, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
which visitors from the out-stations were lodged. The
Chinese, landing on the banks of the Bedil stream,
marched to the attack in a body of about a hundred,
and passing by an upper cottage, made an assault on
the front and back of the long Government House,
the sole inhabitants of which were the Rajah and an
English servant. They did not surround the house, for
their trembling hearts made them fear to separate into
small bodies, as the opinion was rife among them that
the Rajah was a man brave, active, skilled in the use
of weapons, and not to be overcome except by means
of numbers.</p>

<p>Roused from his slumbers by the unusual sounds of
shouts and yells at midnight, the Rajah looked out
through the Venetian blinds, and immediately conjectured
what had occurred. Several times he raised
his revolver to fire at them, but convinced that he
could not defend the house alone he determined to
effect his escape. He supposed that men engaged in
so desperate an enterprise would naturally take every
precaution to ensure its success, and concluded that
bodies of insurgents were silently watching the ends
of the house; so, summoning his English servant, he
led the way down to a bath-room on the ground floor
which communicated with the lawn, and telling him
to open the door quickly and follow close, the Rajah
sprang forth, with sword drawn and revolver cocked,
but found the coast clear. Had there been twenty
Chinese there, he would have passed through them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
as his quickness and practical skill in the use of
weapons were unsurpassed. Reaching the banks of the
stream above his house he paused, observing that it
was full of Chinese boats; but presently, hearing his
alarmed servant, who had lost him in the darkness,
calling to him, he knew that the attention of the
Chinese would be attracted that way, and dived under
the bows of one of the barges and swam to the
opposite shore unperceived. As he was then suffering
from an attack of fever and ague, he fell utterly
exhausted, and lay for some time on the muddy bank
till, slightly recovering, he was able to reach the
Government writer’s house.</p>

<p>An amiable and promising young officer, Mr
Nicoletts, who had but just arrived from an out-station
on a visit to the Rajah, was lodged in a cottage
near; startled by the sound of the attack, he rushed
forth to reach the chief’s house, but was intercepted
and killed by the Chinese, who severed his head from
his body, and bore it on a pike in triumph as that of
the Rajah. Mr Steel, the Resident on the Rejang,
and an experienced officer, quietly looked through the
window of his cottage, and seeing what was passing,
slipped out of the house, and soon found himself
sheltered by the jungle; and the Rajah’s servant, whose
shouts had drawn the Chinese towards him, had to
display very unwonted activity before he could reach
the protecting forest and join Mr Steel.</p>

<p>The other attacks took place simultaneously. Mr<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
and Mrs Crookshank, rushing forth on hearing this
midnight alarm, were cut down, the latter left for
dead, the former seriously wounded. The constable’s
house was attacked; he and his wife escaped, but their
two children and an English lodger were killed by the
insurgents.</p>

<p>Here occurred a scene which showed how cruel
were these Chinese. When the rebels burst into Mr
Middleton’s house he fled, and his wife, following,
found herself in the bath-room, and by the shouts was
soon convinced that her retreat had been cut off. In
the meantime the Chinese had seized her two children,
and brought the eldest down into the bath-room to
show them the way by which the father had escaped.
Mrs Middleton’s sole refuge was a large water jar,
which happened to be full, and she only raised her
mouth above water to draw breath; there she heard
the poor little boy questioned, pleading for his life, and
heard his shriek, when the fatal sword was raised
which severed his head from his body. With loud
laughter these fiends kicked the little head from one
to the other, and then rushed out in pursuit of Mr
Middleton. Fortunately the bath-room was in darkness,
so the mother escaped unseen. The Chinese
then set fire to the house, and she distinctly heard the
shrieks of her second child as they tossed him into the
flames. Mrs Middleton remained in the jar till the
falling embers forced her to leave it. She ran to a
neighbouring pond and, fortunately, was thus sheltered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
from the savages who were rushing round the burning
dwelling. Her escape was indeed extraordinary.</p>

<p>The stockades, however, were not surprised. The
Chinese, waiting for the signal which was to be the
attack on the houses, were at length perceived by a
sentinel, and he immediately roused the Treasurer, Mr
Crymble, who resided in the stockade which contained
the arsenal and the prison. He endeavoured to make
some preparation for defence, although he had but
four Malays with him. He had scarcely time, however,
to load a six-pounder field-piece, and get his own
rifle ready, before the Chinese, with loud shouts,
rushed to the assault. They were led by a man who
bore in either hand a flaming torch. Mr Crymble
waited until they were within forty yards; he then
fired and killed the man who, by the lights he bore,
made himself conspicuous, and before the crowd
recovered from the confusion in which they were
thrown by the fall of their leader, discharged among
them the six-pounder loaded with grape, which made
the assailants retire behind the neighbouring houses or
hide in the outer ditches. But with four men little
could be done; and some of the rebels, having crossed
the inner ditch, began to remove the planks which
constituted the sole defence. To add to the garrison’s
difficulties, they threw over into the inner court little
iron tripods, with flaming torches attached, which
rendered it as light as day, whilst they remained
shrouded in darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>To increase the number of defenders Mr Crymble
released the sole occupants of the prison—a fraudulent
debtor and a Malay madman who had killed his wife
in a fit of fury. The former quickly disappeared,
whilst the latter, regardless of the shot flying around,
stood to the post assigned him, opposite a plank the
Chinese were trying to remove. He had orders to
fire as soon as the first assailant appeared, and when
the plank gave way and a man attempted to force his
body through, he pulled the trigger of his carbine,
without lowering the muzzle, and sent the ball through
his own brains. Mr Crymble now found it useless
to prolong the struggle. One of his four men was
killed, and another, a brave Malay corporal, was shot
down at his side. The wounded man begged Mr
Crymble to fly and leave him to his fate, but asked
him to shake hands with him first and tell him
whether he had not done his duty. The brave Irishman
seized him by the arm and endeavoured to drag
him up the stairs leading to the dwelling over the
gate; but the Chinese had already gained the courtyard,
and pursuing them, drove their spears through
the wounded man. Mr Crymble was forced to
let go his hold, and with a brave follower, Daud,
swung himself down into the ditch below. Some of
the rebels outside the fort, seeing their attempted
escape, tried to stop the Treasurer, and a man stabbed
at him, but the spear only glanced on his thick frieze
coat, and the Chinese received in return a cut across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
the face from the Irishman’s cutlass which was a
remembrance to carry to the grave.</p>

<p>The other stockade, though it had but a corporal’s
watch of three Malays, did not surrender; but finding
that every other place was in the hands of the Chinese,
the brave defenders opened the gate, and, charging
the crowd of rebels, sword in hand, made good their
escape, though all were severely wounded.</p>

<p>The confusion which reigned throughout the rest
of the town may be imagined, as, startled by the
shouts and yells of the Chinese, the inhabitants
rushed to the doors and windows and beheld night
turned into day by the bright flames which rose in
three directions—where the Rajah’s, Crookshank’s and
Middleton’s large houses were all burning at the same
time.</p>

<p>It was at first very naturally thought that the
Chinese contemplated a massacre of the Europeans,
but messengers were soon despatched to them by
the Kungsi to say that nothing was further from
their intention than to interfere with those who were
unconnected with the Government, which refinement
of policy shows that the plan had been concocted by
more subtle brains than those possessed by the gold
workers of Bau.</p>

<p>The Rajah had, as soon as possible, proceeded to
the Datu Bandhar’s house, and being quickly joined
by his English officers, endeavoured to organise a
force with which to surprise the victorious Chinese;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
but it was impossible. No sooner did he collect a few
men than their wives and children surrounded them and
refused to be left behind; and being without proper
arms and ammunition, it was but a panic-stricken
mob. So he instantly took his determination, with
that decision which had been the foundation of his
success, and, giving up the idea of an immediate
attack, advised the removal of the women to the
left-hand bank of the river, where they would be
safe from a land attack of the Chinese, who could
make their way along the right-hand bank of the
river by a road which ran at the back of the town.</p>

<p>This removal was accomplished by the morning,
when the small party of English under the Rajah
walked over to the little river of Siol, which falls
into the Santubong branch of the Sarawak river.
At the mouth of the Siol the Rajah found the war
boat of Abang Buyong, with sixty men, waiting for
him, which was soon joined by six others and many
canoes, for no sooner did the Malays of the neighbouring
villages hear where the Rajah was than they
began flocking to him. He now started for the
Samarahan, intending to proceed to the Balang Lupar
to organise an expedition from the well-supplied forts
there. On their way they rested at the little village
of Sabang, and to the honour of the Malay character
I must add that never during the height of his power
and prosperity did he receive so much sympathy,
tender attention and delicate generosity as now, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
a defeated fugitive. They vied with each other as
to who should supply him and his party with clothes
and food, since they had lost all; and if to know
that he was enshrined in the hearts of the people
was any consolation to him in his misfortunes, he
then had ample proofs of it. No wonder that in
reading these accounts the <cite>Daily News</cite>, hitherto so
hostile to him, should say, ‘We have sincere pleasure
in proclaiming our unreserved admiration of the
manner in which he must have exercised his power
to have produced such fruits.’</p>

<p>When morning broke in Kuching, there was a scene
of the wildest confusion. The six hundred rebels,
joined by the Chinese vagabonds of the town, half-stupefied
by opium, were wandering about in every
direction, discharging their muskets loaded with ball
cartridges. But at eight o’clock the chiefs of the
Gold Company sent a message to the Bishop of
Sarawak, requesting him to come down and attend
the wounded. He did so, and found thirty-two
stretched out, most of them from shot wounds; but
among them he noticed a man with a gash across his
face from the last blow Mr Crymble had struck at
the rebels; and before the Bishop’s arrival they had
buried five of their companions.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs Crookshank had lain on the ground all
night, desperately wounded, and with extraordinary
coolness and courage had shammed death whilst the
rebels tore the rings from her fingers, or cut at her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
head with their swords. Her life was saved by
her mass of braided hair. Early in the morning her
servant found her still living, and went and informed
the Bishop, who had great difficulty in persuading the
Kungsi to allow him to send for her. She arrived in
the mission house in a dreadful state.</p>

<p>It was soon evident that, in the intoxication of
victory, the Chinese aimed now, if not before, at the
complete domination of the country, and summoned
the Bishop, Mr Helms, agent for the Borneo Company,
Mr Ruppell, an English resident, and the Datu
Bandhar to appear at the Court House. The Europeans
were obliged to attend the summons. The Malay
chief also came, but with great reluctance, and contrary
to the advice of the Datu Imaum, his more
energetic brother; but he thought it expedient to
gain time.</p>

<p>The Chinese chiefs, even in their most extravagant
moments of exultation, were in great fear that on
their return up the river the Malays might attack
them in their crowded boats and destroy them, as
on the water they felt their inferiority to their maritime
enemies.</p>

<p>It must have been an offensive sight to the Europeans
and the Malays to witness the arrangements in the
Court House on that day of disaster. In the Rajah’s
chair sat the chief of the Gold Company, supported
on either side by the writers or secretaries, while the
representatives of the now apparently subdued sections<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
took their places on the side benches. The Chinese
chief then issued his orders, which were that Mr
Helms and Mr Ruppell should undertake to rule the
foreign portion of the town, and that the Datu
Bandhar should manage the Malays, while the Gold
Company, as supreme rulers, should superintend the
whole and govern exclusively the up-country districts.
During this time the Europeans could see the head of
Mr Nicoletts carried about on a pole to reassure the
Chinese that the dreaded Rajah had really been killed.
The Chinese chiefs knew better, but they thought
to impose upon their ignorant followers.</p>

<p>Everything now appeared to be arranged, when
the Bishop remarked that perhaps Mr Charles Johnson
might not quite approve of the conduct of the Chinese
in killing his uncle and friends. At the mention of
Johnson’s name there was a pause. A blankness came
over their countenances, and they looked at each
other as they now remembered, apparently for the
first time, that he, the Rajah’s nephew, was the resolute
and popular ruler of the Sakarangs, and could let loose
at least ten thousand wild warriors upon them. At
last it was suggested, after an animated discussion, that
a letter should be sent to him requesting him to confine
himself to his own government, and then they
would not attempt to interfere with him.</p>

<p>They appeared also to have forgotten that there
were Sadong, under Mr Fox, and Rejang, under Mr
Steel, who, between them, could bring thousands into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
the field, and that Seribas also was panting for an
opportunity to find fresh enemies. All this never
seemed to have occurred to them before undertaking
their insensate expedition.</p>

<p>The Chinese were very anxious to have matters
settled at Kuching, as, with all their boasts, they were
not feeling comfortable. They were not only anxious
to secure the plunder they had obtained, but the
leaders knew that the Rajah was not killed, and what
he might be preparing was uncertain. They therefore
called upon the European gentlemen and the
Malay chiefs present to swear fidelity to the Gold
Company, and under the fear of instant death they
were obliged to go through the formula of taking
oaths with the sacrifice of fowls.</p>

<p>Next day the rebels retired up-country unmolested
by the Malays, and a meeting was at once held at
the Datu Bandhar’s house to discuss future proceedings.
At first no one spoke. There was a gloom
over the assembly, as the mass of the population was
deserting the town, carrying off their women and
children to the neighbouring district of Samarahan
as a place of safety, when Abang Patah, son of the
Datu Tumangong, addressed his countrymen. He
was a sturdy man, with a pleasant, cheerful countenance,
and a warm friend to English rule, and his first
words were, ‘Are we going to submit to be governed
by Chinese chiefs, or are we to remain faithful to
our Rajah? I am a man of few words, and I say I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
will never be governed by anyone but by him, and
to-night I commence war to the knife against his
enemies.’</p>

<p>The unanimous determination of the assembly was
to remain faithful to the Rajah, but they were divided
as to the course to be pursued. Patah, however, unfortunately,
cut the knot of the difficulty by manning
a light war boat with a dozen Malays, and proceeding
at once up the river, attacked and captured a Chinese
boat, killing five of its crew. In the meantime all
the women and children had been removed from the
town, and some trading prahus were manned and
armed but imperfectly, as the Chinese had taken
away the contents of the arsenal, and the chief
portion of the crews of the war boats were engaged
in conveying the fugitives to Samarahan.</p>

<p>Patah’s bold act was no doubt well meaning, but
was decidedly premature, as the Malays, being scattered,
could not organise any resistance, and urgent entreaties
were made to the Rajah to return and head this movement.
He complied, as he could not even appear to
abandon those who were fighting so bravely for him;
but he knew it was useless, and arrived at Kuching to
find the rest of the English flying, the town in the
hands of the Chinese, and smoke rising in every
direction from the burning Malay houses.</p>

<p>It appears that when the news reached the Chinese
that the Malays were preparing to resist their rule,
they determined to return immediately to Kuching,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
and attack them before their preparations could be
completed. They divided their forces into two
bodies, as they were now recruited by several
hundreds of men from other gold workings, and had
forced the agriculturists established at Sungei Tungah
to join them; in fact, their great boats could not hold
half their numbers, so one body marched by a new
road which had been opened to the town, while the
other came down by the river.</p>

<p>As soon as the Malays saw the Chinese barges
rounding the point above the town they boldly
dashed at them, forced them to the river banks,
drove out the crews, and triumphantly captured ten
of the largest cargo boats. The Chinese, better
armed, kept up a hot fire from the rising ground, and
killed several of the boldest Malays, among others
Abang Gapoor, whose disbelief in his kinsman’s story
enabled the rebels to surprise the capital, and who to
his last breath bewailed his fatal mistake; and one
who was equally to be regretted, our faithful old
follower, Kassim. The latter lingered long enough to
see the Rajah again successful, and he said he died
happy in knowing it. Notwithstanding their losses,
the Malays towed away the barges, laden, fortunately,
with some of the most valuable booty, and secured
them to a large trading prahu, anchored in the centre
of the river. Having thus captured some superior
arms and ammunition they could better reply to the
fire of their enemies who lined the banks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>In the meantime the Rajah arrived opposite the
Chinese quarter, and found a complete panic prevailing,
and all those Malays and Dyaks who had
preceded him flying in every direction. Having
in vain attempted to restore order, he drew up
his boat on the opposite bank to cover the retreat,
and after a sharp exchange of musketry fire he
returned to Samarahan to carry out his original
intention.</p>

<p>The Rajah joined the fugitives, and his first care
was to see to the safety of the English ladies, the
children, the non-combatants and wounded, and to
send them off, under the charge of Bishop Macdougall
and others, to the secure and well-armed fort of Linga.
He now felt somewhat relieved, as he knew that there
his charges would be in perfect safety, as they were
surrounded by faithful and brave men, who could have
defended the fort against any attack. There were
no enemies at Linga, except such as existed in the
imaginations of the terror-stricken runaways from
Sarawak, who had not yet recovered from their
panic.</p>

<p>The Rajah prepared on the following day to take
the same route, in order to obtain a base of operations
and a secure spot where he could rally the people and
await a fresh supply of arms. It was sad, however,
to think of the mischief which might happen during
this period of enforced inaction, particularly as the
Datu Bandhar and a chosen band were still in Kuching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
on board the large trading vessel, which was surrounded
by lighter war prahus. Here was our gentle Bandhar,
a man whom no one suspected of such energy, showing
the courage of his father, Patingi Ali, who was killed
during Keppel’s Sakarang expedition, and directing
attacks on the Chinese whenever an opportunity
offered. Thus harassed, the rebels were dragging up
heavy guns, and it was evident the Malays could not
hold out for many days, particularly as there was
now little to defend; the flames which reddened the
horizon, and the increasing volumes of smoke, told the
tale too well that the Malay town was being completely
destroyed.</p>

<p>With feelings of the most acute distress the Rajah
gave the order for departure, and the small flotilla fell
down the river Samarahan, and arriving at its mouth
put out to sea, when a cry arose among the men,
‘Smoke! smoke! It is a steamer!’ And sure enough
there was a dark column rising in the air from a three-masted
vessel. For a moment it was uncertain which
course she was steering, but presently they distinguished
her flag—she was the <em>Sir James Brooke</em>, the Borneo
Company’s steamer, standing in for the Muaratabas
entrance of the Sarawak river. The crew of the
Rajah’s prahu, with shouts, gave way, and the boat was
urged along with all the power of their oars, to find
the vessel anchored just within the mouth.</p>

<p>‘The great God be praised!’ as the Rajah said.
Here, indeed, was a base of operations. The native<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
prahus were taken in tow, and the reinforcements of
Dyaks, who were already arriving, followed up with
eager speed. What were the feelings of the Chinese
when they first saw the smoke, then the steamer, it
is not necessary to conjecture. They fired one wild
volley from every available gun and musket, but the
balls fell harmlessly; and when the English guns
opened on them, they fled panic-stricken, pursued by
the rejoicing Malays and Dyaks.</p>

<p>Early that morning a large body of Chinese had
proceeded from the right to the left bank to burn the
half of the Malay town which had hitherto escaped
destruction, but though they succeeded in destroying
the greater portion, they signed their own death
warrant, as the Malays, at the sight of the steamer,
resumed the offensive, seized the boats in which their
enemies had crossed the river, and the Dyaks followed
them up in the forest. Not one of that party could
have escaped. Some wandered long in the jungle and
died of starvation; others were found hanging to the
boughs of trees, having preferred suicide to the lingering
torments of hunger. All these bodies were afterwards
discovered, as they were eagerly sought for.
The natives said that on every one of them were found
from five to twenty pounds sterling in cash, from the
pillage of the public treasury, besides silver spoons and
forks, or other valuables—the plunder of the English
houses.</p>

<p>The main body of the Chinese on the right bank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
retired in some order by the jungle road, and reached
a detachment of their boats which had been sent from
the interior to its terminus, and from thence moved
on to Balidah, opposite Siniawan, the fort famous in
Sarawak history, which the Rajah had besieged on
his first arrival, and which after the insurrection was
over became the headquarters of Charles Grant,
Resident of Upper Sarawak.</p>

<p>Thus was the capital recovered, all burnt, however,
except the Chinese quarter of the town, and the
Mission and Mr Helms’s Borneo Company’s premises.
The Rajah established himself temporarily on board
the <em>Sir James Brooke</em>, and the Government soon began
to work again. The Land Dyaks, who had been faithful
to a man, sent to request permission to attack
the enemy. This being accorded, the chiefs led their
assembled tribes, and rushed in every direction on the
Chinese, driving them from their villages, and compelling
them to defend two places only, Siniawan and
Bau, with Tundong, the landing-place of the latter
town. The smoke rising in every direction showed
them that they were now being punished for the
injuries they had inflicted on others. The Gold
Company, in their blind confidence, had made no
preparations in case of defeat, and it was well
known that their stock of food was small, as everything
had been destroyed at the above-named places
except their own stores, and these were required to
supply the people whom they had forced to join<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
them from the town, and the whole agricultural
population.</p>

<p>The harassing life they led must soon have worn
them out without any attacks, for they could no
longer pursue their ordinary occupations, or even
fetch firewood or water without a strong-armed party,
as the Dyaks hung about their houses, and infested
every spot. It soon became a question of food, and
they found they must either obtain it or retire across
the frontier into Sambas. They therefore collected
all their boats and made a foray eight miles down the
river to Ledah Tanah, and there threw up a
stockade in which they placed a garrison of two
hundred and fifty picked men, under two of their
most trusted leaders. They placed four guns in
position to sweep the river, and, armed with the best
of the Government’s muskets and rifles, they not only
commanded the right and left-hand branches, but
felt secure from a direct attack by the main river.
Parties were then sent out to plunder the Dyak
farmhouses, and one bolder than the rest attempted
to scale the mountain of Serambo to destroy the
Rajah’s country house; but the Dyaks barred the
passage with stockades, and by rolling down rocks on
the advancing party effectually defended their hill.
These Chinese were very different from those we see
in our British settlements. Many of them were half
breeds, having Dyak mothers, and were as active in
the jungle as the aborigines themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>To check the Chinese forays, and afford assistance
to the Land Dyaks, the Rajah sent up the Datu
Bandhar with a small but select force to await his
arrival below the Chinese stockade; but the gallant
Bandhar, on being joined by the Datu Tumangong
and Abang Buyong, and a few Sakarang Dyaks,
dashed at the fort, surprised the garrison at dinner,
and carried it without the loss of a man. The
Chinese threw away their arms and fled into the
jungle, to be pursued and slain by the Sakarang
Dyaks. Stockades, guns, stores and boats were all
captured, and what was of equal importance, the
principal instigators of the rebellion were killed.</p>

<p>As soon as the few that escaped from the fort
reached Siniawan, a panic seized the Chinese there,
and they fled to Bau, where they began hastily to
make preparations to retire over the frontiers. The
Rajah, who was hurrying up to the support of the
Bandhar, hearing of his success, despatched Mr
Johnson with his Dyaks to harass the enemy; these,
together with the Sarawak Malays, to whom most of
the credit is due, pressed on the discomfited Chinese,
who, fearing to have their retreat cut off, started for
Sambas. They were attacked at every step, but being
supplied with the best arms, they were enabled to beat
off the foremost parties of their assailants, and retire
in fair order along the good road which led to the
Dyak village of Gumbang on the Sambas frontier.
Still, this road is very narrow, and every now and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
the active Dyaks made a rush from the jungle that
borders the path and spread confusion and dismay.
But the Chinese had every motive to act a manly part;
it was their only line of retreat, and they had to
defend above a thousand of their women and children,
who encumbered their disastrous flight.</p>

<p>At the foot of the steep hill of Gumbang they made
a halt, for the usual path was found to be well
stockaded, and a resolute body of Malays and Dyaks
were there to dispute the way. It was a fearful
position; behind them the pursuers were gathering
in increasing strength, and unless they forced this
passage within an hour, it must be death or surrender.
At last someone, it is said a Sambas Malay, suggested
that there was another path further along the range,
which, though very steep, was practicable; this was
undefended, and the fugitives made for it.</p>

<p>The Sarawak Malays and Dyaks, seeing too late
their error in neglecting to fortify this path also,
rushed along the brow of the hill, and drove back the
foremost Chinese. Their danger was extreme; but
at that moment, as if by inspiration, all the Chinese
girls rushed to the front, and encouraged the men to
advance. This they again did, and cheered by the
voices of these brave girls, who followed close clapping
their hands, and calling them by name to fight with
courage, they won the brow of the hill, and cleared
the path of their less numerous foes. While this was
going on, another column of Chinese, in the absence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
of most of its defenders, surprised the village of
Gumbang, burnt it to the ground and then crossed
the frontier. They were but just in time, as the
pursuers were pressing hotly on the rearguard, and
the occasional volleys of musketry told them that
the well-armed Malays were upon them; but they
were now comparatively safe, as they were all clear
of the Sarawak frontier, and although a few still
pursued them, the main body of the Malays and
Dyaks would not enter Dutch territory, and halted
on the summit of the Gumbang range.</p>

<p>The miserable fugitives, reduced to two thousand, of
whom above half were women and children, sat down
among the houses of the village of Sidin, and many of
them, it is said, wept not only for the loss of friends
and goods, which they had suffered owing to the
insensate ambition of the Gold Company, but also
because they had to give up all hope of ever returning
to their old peaceful homes.</p>

<p>That Company, which on the night of the surprise
had numbered six hundred, was now reduced to a band
of about one hundred, but these kept well together, and
being better armed than the others, formed the principal
guard of the Tai-pé-Kong, a sacred stone, which they
had, through all their disasters, preserved from the
profane hands of their enemies. Several times the
assailants, who mistook it for the gold chest, were on
the point of capturing it, but on the cry being raised
that the Tai-pé-Kong was in peril, the men gathered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
round and carried it securely through all danger.
At Sidin, however, all immediate apprehension being
over, the discontent of those who had been forced to
join the rebels burst forth without control, so that
from words they soon came to blows, and the small
band of the Company’s men was again reduced by
thirty or forty from the anger of their countrymen.</p>

<p>Continuing their disorderly retreat, they were met
by the officers of the Dutch Government, who very
properly took from them all their plunder and arms,
and being uncertain which was their own property,
erred on the safe side by stripping them of everything.
The Dutch officers sent back to Sarawak all the loot
the Chinese had taken either from the Government or
from private individuals.</p>

<p>Thus terminated the most criminal and causeless
rebellion that ever occurred, which during its continuance
displayed every phase of Chinese character,
arrogance, secrecy, combination, an utter incapability
of looking to the consequences of events or actions,
and a belief in their own power and courage which
every event belied. The Chinese, under their native
leaders, have never fought even decently, and yet up
to the very moment of trial they act as if they were
invincible.</p>

<p>This insurrection showed, in my belief, that though
the Chinese always require watching, they are not in
any way formidable as an enemy; and it also proved
how firmly the Sarawak Government was rooted in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
the hearts of the people, since in the darkest hour
there was no whisper of wavering. Had the Chinese
been five times as numerous, there were forces in the
background which would have destroyed them all.
Before the Chinese had fled across the frontier, the
Seribas and Sakarang Malays and Dyaks, under Mr
Johnson, had arrived, and the people of Sadong were
marching overland to attack them in rear, while the
distant out-stations were mustering strong forces, which
arrived to find all danger past.</p>

<p>I believe that it was almost worth the disaster to
show how uniform justice and generous consideration
are appreciated by the Malays and Dyaks, and how
firmly they may become attached to a Government,
which, besides having their true interests at heart,
encourages and requires all its officers to treat them
as equals. The conduct of the Malay fortmen, of
Kasim and Gapoor, the generous enthusiasm of Abang
Patah, the gallant rush at the Ledah Tanah stockade
by the Bandhar and his followers, showed what the
Rajah had effected during his tenure of power. He
had raised the character of the Malay, and turned a
race notorious for its lawlessness into some of the best-conducted
people in the world.</p>

<p>I may add that the results of the Chinese insurrection
were very curious in a financial point of view.
Though about three thousand men were killed or driven
from the country, yet as soon as quiet was thoroughly
restored, the revenue from the Chinese soon rose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
instead of falling, which proves what an extensive
system of smuggling had been carried on. The
breaking up of the Gold Company was felt by all
the natives as a great relief. It is worthy of remark
that while the Chinese were still unsubdued in the
interior, boats full of their armed countrymen arrived
from Sambas, fully believing that Kuching was now
in the hands of the Kungsi, but on their proceeding
up the river to join them, were met by the Malays,
driven back and utterly defeated.</p>

<p>The Dutch authorities behaved with thorough
neighbourly kindness on this occasion, for as soon
as they heard of the rebellion of the Chinese, they
sent round a steamer and a detachment of soldiers to
the assistance of the Sarawak authorities. Fortunately
by that time all danger was past, but the kindness of
the action was not the less appreciated. H.M.S.
<em>Spartan</em>, Captain Sir William Hoste, also came over
to Sarawak, but I fear that his instructions were less
generous: he could aid in protecting British subjects,
but not the Government of Sarawak. The shadow
of that baneful Commission still hung over the
operations of our navy.</p>

<p>While the Rajah was struggling with all these difficulties,
the <em>Sir James Brooke</em>, which had been sent to
Singapore for supplies, now returned, bringing a large
party to join him—his nephew, Captain Brooke, and
Mrs Brooke, Mr Grant, Mr Hay, a new recruit, of
whom the Rajah said: ‘A gentlemanly man, young,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
of good family, and of the right stamp,’ in truth, the
only class of officer suitable for the work. There
came also many people connected with the Borneo
Company, including Mr Harvey, the managing
director, Mr Duguid, the head of the Sarawak
branch, and others. In giving me an account of the
arrivals, the Rajah wrote: ‘Our domestic intelligence
is of the best and pleasantest. Brooke’s wife is a
sweet, sensible, but playful creature, charming in
manners.’</p>

<p>When the news of the Chinese insurrection reached
Seribas, all the chiefs were anxious to go to the help
of the Government, and while many of them were
away in Sarawak, our old Sakarang adversary, Rentab,
of Lang Fort reputation, attacked the villages of our
friends. The Rajah therefore determined to punish
him, and started for Seribas himself to encourage the
well intentioned, and Captain Brooke visited the
Rejang, while Mr Charles Johnson was ordered to
attack Sadok, the chief’s mountain stronghold, with
his Malays and Dyaks. The attack failed, however,
though Charles Johnson exposed himself to every
danger to secure success.</p>

<p>I went down to Sarawak by the first opportunity,
and reached it in July, to find everything proceeding
as if no insurrection had occurred. Though the
Malay town had been burnt to the ground, yet the
inhabitants had soon recovered their energy, and had
rebuilt their houses, which, though not so substantial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
as the former ones, still looked very neat. Some
things were missed in the landscape: the handsome
Government House, with its magnificent library, had
disappeared; and there were other gaps to be filled
up, but fortunately the Chinese had had no time to
destroy the church, the mission house, or the Borneo
Company’s premises.</p>

<p>I never saw a more perfect library than that destroyed
by the Chinese, perfect in everything—the
best historians and essayists, all the poets, the most
celebrated voyages and travels, books of reference, and
a whole library of theology and law, as well as a
goodly array of the best novels. Besides losing his
beloved library, the Rajah was at the same time deprived
of all the records of his previous life, for he had collected
his journals and papers, and these shared the fate
of his books. He was, as I have said, a great reader,
and had latterly devoted himself to the study of international
law. He remembered the salient points of a
question with great accuracy, and could explain clearly
every subject he studied. He had a wonderful gift
of language.</p>

<p>I found, as I had expected, that the loss of worldly
wealth had had little effect on my old chief, who was
as cheerful and contented in his little, comfortless
cottage as he had ever been in Government House.
His health, which before the insurrection had not been
strong, had wonderfully improved through his great
exertions in endeavouring to restore the country to its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
former prosperous state, and I never saw him more full
of bodily energy and mental vigour than during the
two months I spent in Sarawak in 1857. Everyone
took the tone of the leader. There were no useless
regrets over losses, and it was amusing to hear the congratulations
of the Malay chiefs,—‘Ah, Mr St John,
you were born under a fortunate star to leave Sarawak
just before the evil days came upon us.’ Then they
would recount the personal incidents which had occurred
to themselves, and tell with great amusement
the shifts to which they had been put for the want of
every household necessary. There was a cheerfulness
and a hope in the future which promised well for the
country.</p>

<p>I found that the deserted gardens around the town
had been in part reoccupied, for already Chinese were
cultivating them. In order to avoid interrupting the
narrative, I have not before noticed that during the
height of the insurrection, when the rebels had only
been driven from the town a few days, news came that
several hundred Chinese, fugitives from the Dutch
territories, had crossed the frontier near the sources
of the left-hand branch of the Sarawak, and were
seeking the protection of the Rajah’s Government.
Though harassed by incessant work, he did not
neglect their appeal, but immediately despatched
trustworthy men; and they were thus safely piloted
through the excited Dyaks, who thought that every
man that ‘wore a tail’ should now be put to death.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
No incident could better illustrate the great influence
possessed by the Rajah over Dyaks and Malays, or his
thoughtful care for the true interests of his country,
during even the most trying circumstances.</p>

<p>When the insurrection was completely over, the
Rajah sent Sherif Moksain to Sambas with communications
for the Dutch authorities. As the Sherif had
been at one time in charge of the Chinese in the
interior he knew them well, and he said it was distressing
to see the unfortunate agriculturists, who
had been made to join the rebels, lamenting their
expulsion from the country. They begged for permission
to return, and subsequently many did, and
established themselves in their old quarters.</p>

<p>Thus ended the second plot against the Rajah’s life
and authority, the direct outcome of the loss of prestige
and strength which followed the appointment of the
commission sent to try him for high crimes and misdemeanours,
the favourable findings of which had
never been brought home to the native mind by any
act of reparation made by the British Government.</p>

</div>


<p class="no-indent">The insurrection over, and all his absent officers returned
from England, the Rajah had more time for
the rest he required; but no sooner had a little calm
been restored to him, than he was strongly moved
by the news of the Mutiny in India. ‘He turned
clammy with agitation when he first heard of it’;
and how true is the ring of the following—‘I felt
then, annoyed and disgraced though I have been, that
I was an Englishman, and the ties and feelings which
men have wantonly outraged are planted too deep to
be torn up.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>Though it is highly probable that the many
changes which had taken place in the management
of the army in India had conduced to the Mutiny, by
separating the officers from their men, and weakening
the dependence of the soldiers on their superiors in
order to concentrate everything in the hands of the
War Department at Calcutta or elsewhere, yet one
of its causes was the great increase in the number
of married officers, who were completely out of touch
with the native element, and heard nothing of what
was going on among the men in the regiment.</p>

<p>A little later the Rajah wrote to his nephew,
Captain Brooke: ‘I have sometimes thought that
since the earlier days the bonds of sympathy between
the native and European have been slacker.’ These
words reflected the thoughts which had arisen in my
own mind during the visit I paid to Sarawak in 1857.
It was not so much that there was any outward sign
of the mutual sympathy being less, but there was
little of that old familiar intercourse which undoubtedly
produced and fostered it. And this, ungallant as the
opinion may seem, I put down to the presence of
the ladies. After dinner they retired to the drawing-room,
and we could hear music and singing going
on, and most of the gentlemen were eager to join
them. The native chiefs, and others who had continued
their evening visits, soon became aware of this,
and gradually they frequented Government House
less and less, and finally ceased going except when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
business called them there. Under these conditions
the same intimate friendship could not continue. I
have been so long absent from Sarawak that I know
but little of the present state of affairs there, but I
fear that the former easy intercourse was never wholly
re-established, and that those pleasant evenings with
the best class of natives are things of the distant past,
in fact, of the days of the old Rajah.</p>

<p>For these and many other reasons I think that gentlemen
who govern native states should not marry, or if
an exception be made in favour of the chief, certainly
his subordinates, who are employed in out-stations
where natives abound, should not be married. And
this rule might well be applied to the officers sent to
our North-Western frontier in India. Marriage immediately
separates the governors from the governed.
Ladies as a rule cannot be brought to understand that
the natives can in any case be considered as equals,
and are apt to despise them accordingly. With such
ideas, how can bonds of sympathy exist between the
rulers and the ruled?</p>

<p>At that time, 1857, the Sago Rivers, north-east of
the Rejang, were very much disturbed. Though there
were some extenuating circumstances, the action of
Sarawak was not altogether free from blame. A
quarrel had arisen between two native chiefs, one
the governor of the district of Muka Pangeran Nipa,
and the other his cousin, Pangeran Matusin. The first
act of the tragedy was that the latter dashed into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
house of the former and murdered him and eleven of
his women and children. The second was the driving
out of Matusin and the slaughter of thirty-five of
his friends and relations. Sarawak, then administered
by the Rajah’s nephew, unfortunately sided with
Matusin, and interfered with arms in her hands
within the Sultan’s territory.</p>

<p>Before, however, these latter acts occurred, the Rajah
had been to Brunei to try and induce the Sultan to let
him settle matters in the Sago Rivers,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and although no
formal documents were executed he was requested to
see that right was done, but the Sultan would have
nothing to do with that man of violence, Matusin.
The Rajah went to Muka, and a period of calm
followed this visit, but nothing was settled on a
permanent basis.</p>

<p>Sir James now decided to proceed to England, as
many important affairs required his presence there.
On his arrival he found everyone disposed to treat
him with distinction, and Lords Clarendon and
Palmerston were especially cordial. They even
offered a Protectorate, all that was really wanted
to ensure the stability of Sarawak and its future progress.
But that unfortunate Commission had made
the Rajah suspicious of Ministers. He thought they
might grant a Protectorate, and then thoroughly
neglect Borneo affairs. This was, no doubt, an error,
as under the Protectorate of England, Sarawak has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
progressed to its present prosperous state without needing,
or being required to submit to, the slightest interference
on the part of Her Majesty’s Government.
The Rajah thought, however, that if England had a
monetary interest in Sarawak she would be more apt to
look after the nascent State. He therefore asked that
they should repay him the money he had expended in
bringing the country to its present condition. Another
reason for this request was that after the Chinese
insurrection he had been compelled to borrow £5000
from the Borneo Company, and he wished to repay
it. Every penny of his own fortune had been spent,
and his only assured income was the pension of £70
which had been granted to him on account of the
wound received in Burmah. But this does not alter
my opinion that he should have accepted the Protectorate
without further question. The Government
next offered to establish a naval station in one of the
ports of Sarawak; why this was not accepted I never
heard.</p>

<p>On February 21, 1858, Sir James Brooke went to a
Drawing-Room, and Her Majesty spoke to him most
graciously, and the Prince Consort shook him cordially
by the hand; indeed, the Royal Family ever showed
the greatest interest in his career; and his reception at
the Prime Minister’s greatly pleased him.</p>

<p>Then came a change of Ministry, as Lord Palmerston
had been defeated on the Conspiracy Bill, and the
Rajah instantly felt a difference in the tone adopted towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
him by the Government. Lord Derby cared
little for Borneo, though his son, then Lord Stanley,
showed a very appreciative interest in Sarawak.</p>

<p>The Rajah’s friends thought that by continually
agitating, by dinners, meetings, and deputations, they
might influence the Government, and they persuaded
him to join in the movement, but upon a temperament
so nervous as the Rajah’s this wrought infinite
mischief. His nephews also were wounding his feelings
by writing from Sarawak that the Rajah desired
to ‘sell Sarawak into bondage.’ No wonder he felt
dreadfully ‘hurt and humiliated,’ and cried out that
‘he was weary, weary of heart, without faith, without
hope in man’s honesty.’</p>

<p>On the 21st October 1858, after making a brief
speech in the Free Trade Hall at Manchester, he says,
‘I felt a creeping movement come over me. I soon
knew what it was, and walked with Fairbairn<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> to the
doctor’s. Life, I thought, was gone, and I rejoiced
in the hope that my death would do for Sarawak what
my life had not been able to effect.’ Thus the Rajah
described his first attack of paralysis. This closed his
active participation in the movement, though his friends
did all they could, and a very strong effort was made
to interest the commercial classes and induce the
Government to do something in support of his position
in Borneo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>As soon as the Rajah could be moved with safety,
he went to his cottage at Godstone to rest, but with
little result, as his friends were then negotiating with
the English Government respecting Sarawak. His
views on the subject were quite clear and he was now
strongly in favour of a Protectorate. Many wished
the Government to take the country over as a Crown
colony, but that would have proved an expensive failure,
as the people were not sufficiently advanced to bear
the necessary taxation.</p>

<p>A great deputation, one of the most influential
that ever waited on a Minister, had an interview with
Lord Derby, but all to no purpose. His lordship was
as unsympathetic as he could well be. He failed to
appreciate the noble conduct of the Rajah, and could
only look upon his efforts in Sarawak as a sort of
speculation—half commercial, half political. He had
evidently not taken the trouble to study the subject, or
he was incapable of appreciating a generous nature.
But the Cabinet was not of the same opinion, and
soon overtures were made by Lord Malmesbury with
reference to a Protectorate being granted by England.
Before anything could be settled, however, Lord
Derby’s Ministry resigned.</p>

<p>The Rajah was now again worried by his pecuniary
embarrassments. The Borneo Company pressed for the
repayment of the £5000 advanced after the Chinese
insurrection, but a generous lady came forward and
freed him from this claim. At the same time some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
of his friends raised a testimonial to mark the appreciation
of his public work. Had there not been some
underhand opposition by those who pretended to
support it, it might have reached the amount expected,
namely, £20,000, but it only realised £8800. With a
portion of this he bought the small estate of Burrator
on the skirts of Dartmoor, and here he ever felt truly at
home. He became strongly attached to the place, and
it was difficult to make him leave it even for a season.
It was a charmingly wild spot, under the shadow of the
great tors which render the country about them so
wonderfully picturesque. The air is pure and bracing,
and his sojourn there may be said to have relit the
lamp of life which had been almost extinguished.</p>

<p>In Sarawak affairs were in a bad state. The unreasonable
efforts made by its Government to support
Pangeran Matusin in Muka, the savage instigator of
the civil war, were the cause of much strife, and the
illegal conduct of the officer administering the Government
was deeply resented in Borneo. The Sarawak
officials were possessed with the monomania that the
Sultan of Borneo was always intriguing against them,
which was a pure myth, as the Brunei Government had
neither the energy nor the power to affect them.</p>

<p>The intriguers were within their own territories,
for whilst they were watching for outside plots and
hostile action, a dangerous conspiracy was being
hatched by some discontented chiefs. The heads of
this conspiracy were the ex-Datu Patingi Gapoor, now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
named Datu Haji, as he had made the pilgrimage
to Mecca, who had been permitted to return to
Sarawak after the Chinese insurrection, and Sherif
Musahor, a chief of Arabian descent, established on
the Rejang. The first evidence of this treachery
was the surprise of the fort at Kanowit, and the
murder of two Sarawak officers, Messrs Fox and
Steele. Yet so ignorant of the real plotters were the
English officials at the capital, that when an expedition
was sent to punish the murderers, Tani, one of
our best friends, was accused as an accomplice and was
executed. As he was led forth to death he protested
his innocence, but added, ‘You will soon know who is
the real culprit.’ In the end not one of the actual
murderers escaped, as they were tracked for years, and
were all ultimately killed.</p>

<p>Sherif Musahor, however, was the real instigator of
these murders, and the truth soon came out that the
Datu Haji and he were the promoters of all the
disturbances. The former was banished and the latter
driven out of the country. He had practically no
influence in Sarawak, and the Malay chiefs were as
ready to follow Charles Johnson in his campaign
against him as against any other enemy of the
Government. All the stories about his mysterious
influence were all nonsense, and had no effect on the
minds of the Sarawak people.</p>

<p>Some of the biographers of Sir James Brooke have
fallen into the error of supposing that Sarawak was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
abandoned by the English Government during these
perilous years. This, as I have already shown, was not
so, for immediately after the Chinese insurrection,
both Lord Palmerston and Lord Clarendon offered a
Protectorate, but this offer was refused, except under
conditions difficult for the British Government to
accept. A naval station placed within Sarawak
territory was also proposed; this likewise was rejected.
Therefore, it must be confessed, the charge of entirely
abandoning Sarawak was not well founded, as the
refusal to accept British protection tied the hands of
Ministers. The British Government went as far as
they thought they could safely go, but, as I have already
remarked, the Rajah did not feel satisfied with a bare
Protectorate, as he mistrusted their sincerity.</p>

<p>On my way home from Brunei to England, early in
1860, I stopped at Singapore, and falling in there
with Charles Grant, who had come over to recruit an
English crew for a small gunboat, I heard of all that
had been going on in the Rajah’s territories. I resolved
to go over to Sarawak to judge of the situation
for myself, so as to be able to carry home the latest
news to Sir James Brooke. All real danger was now
past. The energy and courage of the Rajah’s nephew,
Charles Johnson, the present Rajah, had triumphed over
all difficulties, and the coast as far as the Rejang was
completely tranquil. It is easy to be wise after the
event, but I did not then believe, nor do I believe now,
that the Sarawak Malays were in any way affected by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
the plottings of the Datu Haji or of Sherif Musahor.
They were afraid of some assassinations of foreigners
until the former chief was banished the country, but
on my arrival, in March 1860, I found them as sound
and as loyal as ever they had been. If they had not
been so, there was nothing to prevent them expelling
every European from the country. They were all
unanimous in their praise of the manner in which
Charles Johnson had met the danger and crushed it.</p>

<p>Things were indeed now about to assume a
brighter aspect. The same generous lady who had
paid off the debt due to the Borneo Company found
the money to buy a steamer, and with a steamer the
stability of Sarawak would be finally established. The
Rajah visited Glasgow to look out for a suitable one,
and soon selected the <em>Rainbow</em>, for so he christened
her, as the emblem of hope. Arriving in England
shortly after this purchase, I went down to Scotland
with my old chief to see the steamer start. There was
no more despondency. He would nail his colours to the
mast. In fact, the presence of the steamer on the
coast as the property of the Sarawak Government
closed the period of alarms, of plots and troubles, and
since then I do not believe there has been a single
dangerous conspiracy to check the progress of this little
kingdom. But before the <em>Rainbow</em> arrived on the
coast there was to be one more difficulty.</p>

<p>When Johnson drove Sherif Musahor out of the
districts subject to Sarawak, he first fled to Muka,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
and then proceeded to Brunei and Labuan. His
stories did not influence the Sultan, who knew the
man, and was well persuaded that he had instigated
the murder of Fox and Steele. Indeed, before I left
Brunei, he had confided to me his suspicions. But
the Sultan was still angry with the action of Sarawak,
which had treated his sovereign rights with great
contempt, so he encouraged the fugitive to proceed
to Labuan and lay his complaints before Governor
Edwardes, who was known to be hostile both to Sir
James Brooke and his rising raj. This led to an
interchange of views between the Governor and the
Sultan, in which I fear the former promised to use
all his influence to lower the position of His
Highness’s great feudatory, and he sent for a ship
of war to carry out his intentions. Unfortunately,
he obtained an Indian steamer, the <em>Victoria</em>, instead
of one of Her Majesty’s navy. No naval officer
would have countenanced his proceedings.</p>

<p>Early in 1860, Captain Brooke returned to Sarawak
and took over the administration of the Government, and
I am persuaded he had the firm intention of living at
peace with his neighbours, but he found that the high-handed
proceedings of the previous year had been so
deeply resented that the Governor of Muka, Pangeran
Dipa, son of the murdered chief, had ordered all the Sarawak
trading vessels to leave his district, and having fortified
the entrance to the Muka River, awaited the effect of
Sherif Musahor’s appeal to the Acting Consul-General.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>Captain Brooke, thinking that he could settle these
difficulties by negotiation, went with a small force
to Muka to interview Pangeran Dipa, determined
to try every method of conciliation, but no sooner
did his vessels enter the Muka than the guns of the
fort opened fire on them. Captain Brooke thereupon
retired to the entrance of the river, built a stockade,
and sent for reinforcements. These soon came
pouring in, a brisk attack was opened upon the
enemy, and success would soon have crowned their
efforts, had not Governor Edwardes appeared in his
steamer and commanded Captain Brooke on his
allegiance to suspend his operations. He naturally
protested against such interference, but prudently
withdrew his forces, and retired to Sarawak. The
Governor had brought down with him Sherif Musahor,
the murderer of his fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>Captain Brooke now appealed for justice to the
British Government, and Lord John Russell, who
was at the Foreign Office, thanked him for his
conciliatory and prudent conduct, and then took
Mr Edwardes in hand.</p>

<p>When I left Brunei early in 1860, I had requested
Mr Edwardes to accept the acting appointment of
Consul-General, which had enabled him to interfere
on the coasts of the Sultan’s dominions. But as soon
as I heard of his violent proceedings I could not but
offer to sacrifice my leave and return to Borneo to
resume my official duties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>Sir James Brooke decided to go back to the East
by the same mail in which I had taken my passage.
From Singapore the Rajah went over to Sarawak
in his own steamer, the <em>Rainbow</em>, and I followed in
H.M.S. <em>Nimrod</em>, Captain Arthur. I called in at
Kuching, and there addressed a letter to the Council
of Sarawak, stating that Her Majesty’s Government
disapproved of Mr Edwardes’s interference. I then
went on to Labuan, relieved my substitute of his
position as Consul-General, and proceeded to my
post in Brunei. I found the Sultan very reserved,
and rumours were rife that the Governor of Labuan
had promised not only to interfere in Muka, but to
remove all the English from Sarawak, and restore
that country to the Sultan. This, I imagine, was
but an invention of the Oriental mind, which jumped
too hastily to conclusions. At all events the Sultan
and all his high officers of State were still very
angry, and naturally so, at the original armed interference
of Sarawak within their territory. But
when they found that the Rajah himself had arrived
at Kuching, that he would pay over all the fines his
nephews had raised within the Sultan’s frontiers, and
that he was prepared to make advantageous proposals
to the Brunei Government, their brows cleared, and
I found myself once more a welcome visitor in their
Halls of Audience.</p>

<p>The Rajah arrived, and matters were soon explained
and arranged. The Brunei Government decided to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
banish Sherif Musahor from their dominions, and to
send for the Governor of Muka to explain his conduct.
I was requested by both parties to act as
mediator, and I went as soon as possible to Muka
in Her Majesty’s corvette <em>Charybdis</em>, Captain Keane.
We entered the river with all the boats of the ship,
and were soon behind the fortifications with two
hundred marines and blue-jackets. This judicious
display of force awed these turbulent chiefs. No show
of resistance was made, and both Sherif Musahor and
Pangeran Dipa decided to obey the Sultan’s mandate.</p>

<p>Little, therefore, remained to be done. The Rajah
went up to Muka with a large squadron, and all the
chiefs there kept their word and submitted. Dipa
went off to Brunei, and Musahor was exiled to the
Straits Settlements. With all his faults, nay, crimes,
I could not but pity him. He had been such a
good fellow in former years, and he had been so
injudiciously treated by the local Sarawak officers
with whom he had come in contact, men very
inferior to him in every way, and totally unfitted to
deal with a man of rank, a supposed descendant of
the prophet Mahomed. He lived for many years in
Singapore, but I do not know whether he is still
alive.</p>

<p>The Rajah took up his residence for some weeks
in the fort at Muka to endeavour to restore order
in what might be called a regular chaos of misgovernment,
and succeeded to a great extent. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
regretted by all that his stay was so short, as his
magnetic influence over the natives was so remarkable
that they all were ready to carry out his views and
submit to his superior judgment. No one only
accustomed to European countries could imagine the
confused state of affairs, for no man among the
lower classes appeared to know whether he was a
free man or a slave, and if the latter, who was his
master, as he had probably been sold half-a-dozen
times by people who had no authority over him.
However, in most cases, these sales were more
nominal than real, as the self-created masters, unless
chiefs, seldom attempted to enforce their fictitious
rights.</p>

<p>We soon went to Brunei again, and then the
Rajah gladdened the heart of the Sultan by taking
over the Sago districts on a yearly payment of four
thousand five hundred dollars, and giving him a year’s
revenue in advance. Past complaints were now put
on one side, and all was peace.</p>

<p>I had been promoted to be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chargé d’Affaires</i> in
Hayti, so that as soon as I had introduced my successor
to the Sultan, I prepared to proceed home;
but as the Rajah had decided to leave for England
also, we returned together to Sarawak, where he
wished to arrange some affairs before bidding adieu
to Borneo.</p>

<p>At his nephew, Captain Brooke’s, request he publicly
installed him as Rajah Muda or heir apparent, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
left him in charge of the Government. To this
ceremony Sir James Brooke summoned all the
principal men of the country, and introducing Captain
Brooke as the Rajah Muda, bade them all farewell;
adding, however, that should his presence ever be
necessary, he would return to resume the Government
and to aid them in their difficulties. I never heard
a better speech; many of the audience burst into
tears, and all were deeply moved.</p>

<p>Definite explanations were exchanged between the
uncle and his nephew, which gave the Rajah a free
hand in all negotiations in England, and these arrangements
were reduced to writing. I also had a distinct
explanation with Captain Brooke as to his views, so
that I might advance them as far as I could agree
with them.</p>

<p>We started for Singapore in the <em>Rainbow</em>, and, as
we were detained there by an accident to the mail
steamer, the inhabitants of the settlement, to show
that no unkind feeling remained in any section of
society, gave the Rajah a ball. At supper his health
was drunk with all the honours; some good speeches
were made, and most of his friends then said farewell
to him, thinking they should see his face no more.
Though rejoiced at my removal from Brunei, I
could not leave the Further East without regret, as
I had spent many happy years there.</p>

<p>Among Sir James Brooke’s most active friends and
supporters was Mr John Abel Smith, who was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
intimate with Lord John Russell, our Foreign Minister,
and, in 1862, he opened negotiations with him and
other Ministers for the recognition of Sarawak as an
independent State. At first there was a proposal to
make it a Crown Colony, but that was prudently
discarded. Then a Protectorate was proposed, and
at last all the negotiations centred on one point, the
recognition of Sarawak. There was little or no
opposition in the Ministry, when someone unfortunately
suggested that Lord Elgin, the Governor-General
of India, should send over an official to report on the
actual condition of Sarawak. The Governor of the
Straits Settlements, Colonel Cavanagh, was chosen to
prosecute this enquiry. Instead of simply carrying out
his instructions, he showed Captain Brooke the secret
and confidential papers which had been entrusted to
him. The latter thought that his rights were being
tampered with, whereas, had he been fully informed,
he would have found that recognition was the only
question then under the consideration of the Ministry.
But Captain Brooke was not quite himself at that time.
He had just lost his second wife and his eldest son, and
the inquisitiveness of the Governor probably chafed
him. Whatever may have been the cause, he wrote
to Lord John Russell to say that the country could not
be handed over to England without his and the people’s
consent, and then sent a defiant letter to his uncle
announcing that he had assumed the government of
the country and would defend his rights by force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>The Rajah could not accept such a defiance. He
returned to Sarawak, met his repentant nephew at
Singapore, and sent him home on leave. Bad
advisers in England induced him to withdraw his
submission, and it ended in a complete estrangement
between the uncle and nephew. He was deposed
from his position as heir apparent, and thenceforth
he ceased to have any interest in Sarawak. He
had been my most intimate friend, and I regretted
his action exceedingly, particularly as it was one of
my own confidential memoranda to our Government
which had incited his ire. This memorandum related
to a different question from that which was before
the Government, and had he been more patient he
would have learnt that Lord John Russell fully
recognised the inhabitants of Sarawak as a free
people, whose consent would have been necessary
to any transfer.</p>

<p>When the news reached England that the Rajah’s
authority was uncontested in Sarawak, and that
Captain Brooke had retired from the scene, Lord
John Russell determined to acknowledge its independence,
and appointed a consul, who had to ask for his
<em>exequatur</em> from the Sarawak Government. Thus
this much vexed question closed to the satisfaction of
all those who loved and admired the Rajah, but not to
that of a group of false friends who had been working
against him in all kinds of underhand ways. But as
these are now turned to dust I will not refer to them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
again. It was a triumph for the Rajah, and was the
reward of his constancy, of his high principle, his
irreproachable character and devotion to his people.
The evilly-disposed were now silenced, and left him
at peace for the remainder of his life.</p>

<p>I was at that time in Hayti and did not see the
Rajah during the years 1863, 1864 and 1865, but we
kept up a constant correspondence. I could not rise
superior to injuries as he did, and in one of my letters
I slightly reproached him with appearing to forgive
a person who had deeply injured him, and remained
impenitent. His answer shows the kindly nature of
the man. ‘True it is he injured me, and deeply,
and perhaps what you say is true, he will injure me
again, but in Sarawak <em>I cannot quarrel</em> or feel resentment
against anyone, however great the evil done to
myself.’</p>

<p>Mr Ricketts was named consul at Sarawak, and he
soon sent home highly interesting reports about the
country. He stayed there two years, but as there
was really nothing for a consul to do, a vice-consul
succeeded him. At present Great Britain has a vice-consul
at Brunei, who is accredited to the Rajah of
Sarawak as well as to the Sultan.</p>

<p>The Rajah, during these years, really enjoyed life.
His anxieties had almost ceased. The revenues
of Sarawak were improving, thus ensuring increased
stability. There was both peace and contentment
there, and trade was rapidly extending throughout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
all its dependencies. His own health was remarkably
good, and he could enjoy visits to country
houses, and occasionally indulge in partridge shooting.
He could now write, ‘In spite of trials and
anxieties, calumny and misrepresentation, <em>I have been
a happy man</em>, and can pillow my head with the
consciousness of a well-spent life of sacrifice and
devotion to a good cause.’</p>

<p>I never knew a man so ready to help when he saw
the strong oppress the weak. As an instance of this,
he boldly threw the weight of his influence on the side
of Bishop Colenso, when he saw the great Church
dignitaries ready to condemn him.</p>

<p>The Rajah spent much of his time during the
remaining years of his life at Burrator, and became
as popular and as beloved among the small farmers
and cottagers as ever he had been in the Far East
during the height of his prosperity. He often took
me to visit these rough but kindly people, and it was
a pleasure to see how they all greeted him. I particularly
noticed how the children would run out of the
cottages to touch his hand, as if his gentle smile fascinated
them. He did all he could for the parish, helped
to restore the ruined church, and, in 1865, was cheered
by the arrival of a clergyman and his wife, Mr and
Mrs Dakyn, who remained his kind and tender
friends to the day of his death.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1866 he received a severe
shock. His nephew wrote that he had sold the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
steamer <em>Rainbow</em> to pay off a debt due to their
Singapore agent—a debt incurred through careless
extravagance in carrying out too many public works
at a time. For a moment it almost stupefied him, as
this steamer had not yet been paid for. We soon
proved to him, however, that there was but little cause
for uneasiness, as the Sarawak revenue was ample to
meet all disbursements, if more care were exercised
in the expenditure on public works. But Sarawak
without a steamer, he felt assured, would sink back
into its old state of insecurity, and therefore a steamer
must be had. By great exertion he succeeded in
raising the necessary funds, and purchased a vessel
which was christened the <em>Royalist</em>, after his famous
yacht.</p>

<p>I stayed with the Rajah at Burrator during the
autumn of 1866, and he appeared very much stronger.
He took his daily rides and walks, but he was
full of anxiety about Sarawak, which continued
until the steamer was secured. When we were
alone we would take our afternoon ride and then
return to tea, and between that meal and dinner
he enjoyed his reading. He liked to have someone
with him, and every now and then would put down
his book and talk of any question that was then
interesting him. After a while he would resume his
reading and we would both remain quiet for a time.
I never knew anyone who understood better what has
been called ‘the luxury of silence.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>Two or three days before Christmas I left
Burrator for London, and we went up together as far
as Plymouth. I never saw the Rajah more gay or
full of spirits, and he played whist with great enjoyment,
but on his return home, the next day, he was
struck down by a second attack of paralysis, and we
were hastily summoned to his bedside. He partially
recovered, but was never again able to write. His
career was closed. He lived on, however, for about
two years, when the final attack came at Burrator
where, fortunately, he was surrounded by many of his
nearest relatives. He died on the 11th June 1868.
After his third attack he did not recover consciousness,
but passed peacefully away. He was buried at
Burrator under the yew tree in the churchyard, at
the spot he had chosen himself. His death was felt
by all his neighbours as a personal loss, as he was, in
truth, the friend of everyone in his parish.</p>

<p>More than thirty years have passed since the Rajah’s
death, and yet the admiration for his character and his
great qualities has but increased among those who knew
him well or could appreciate the work he had done. I
have endeavoured to portray him as he appeared to me,
but there was a grandeur about his personality which
it is difficult to describe. He could not enter a room
without the impression being conveyed that you were
in the presence of great superiority, and yet in
manner he was ever simple and courteous.</p>

<p>The purity of his private life was such that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
could not but impress both natives and Europeans,
and that magnetic influence, as it is called, which he
undoubtedly possessed was but the result of a superior
mind, ever influenced by a kindly heart. He was a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevalier sans peur et sans reproche</i>, and it will be
difficult to look upon his like again.</p>

<p>The Rajah bequeathed Sarawak to his nephew,
the present Sir Charles Brooke, G.C.M.G. He
had lived to see the country prosper, and died
without anxiety as to its future. The public
debt due to him by Sarawak, he passed on to
his successor, and the only encumbrance remaining
was for the money advanced to buy the steamers,
and the warlike expenditure incurred during the
Muka expedition. This was but a slight burden on
the finances, and was soon paid off. I rather dwell
on this subject, as an unfounded statement has
been made that at the Rajah’s death Sarawak
was a bankrupt State. There is no ground for
such an assertion. The paltry debt due was covered
tenfold by the value of the ships, the buildings,
the public works, and the rising revenue which
had accrued principally from the security given
by the presence on the coast of Borneo of the
steamers in the service of Sarawak.</p>

<p>I will add a copy of the Rajah’s will, as far
as it relates to public matters:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The last will and testament of Sir James Brooke,
K.C.B., Rajah of Sarawak. I, James Brooke, Rajah
of Sarawak, of Burrator, in the County of Devon,
give, devise and bequeath all that my sovereignty
of Sarawak, aforesaid, and all the rights and privileges
whatsoever thereto belonging unto my nephew,
Charles Johnson Brooke, Tuan Muda of Sarawak,
son of the Rev. Francis Charles Johnson, and the
heirs male of his body lawfully issuing; and
in default of such issue unto my nephew, Stuart
Johnson, another son of the said Francis Charles
Johnson, and the heirs male of his body lawfully
issuing; and in default of such issue I give, devise
and bequeath the said sovereignty, its rights and
privileges, unto Her Majesty, the Queen of England,
her heirs and assigns for ever; and I appoint Miss

Piccadilly, and Thomas Fairbairn, of the city of
Manchester, Esquire, and John Abel Smith, of Chester

carried into effect. I bequeath to my said
nephew, Charles Johnson Brooke, his heirs, executors
and administrators, all my real and personal estate

him likewise my residuary legatee.’ (After
mentioning some private legacies which he wished
paid, he added), ‘I leave all my papers to the

<p class="no-indent">I have found materials for writing this chapter in the
numbers of the Sarawak <cite>Gazette</cite>, an official journal
published once a month. I have read its contents
with great interest, as every district to which it
refers was once familiar to me, and I am able to
trace clearly the changes which have taken place
since I left Borneo. I might rather have used
the word expansion, as in truth the changes have
not been so great as might have been expected.</p>

<p>The Government is carried on as it was in
the old days. The Rajah is <em>de facto</em> an irresponsible
ruler, though he can summon the Sarawak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
Council to meet and advise him as to any new law,
or any modification to be made in the financial
arrangements of the country; and I understand that
the Rajah always consults them on such occasions.
This Council is composed of the Rajah and two of
the senior English officers, and four native chiefs
of Sarawak Proper. It was the Earl Grey of 1855
who recommended its establishment to the old
Rajah, and it has proved itself exceedingly useful.
Its first meetings took place in 1856.</p>

<p>There is also a General Council composed of the
chiefs of the various districts under the rule of the
Rajah, with a due proportion of English officers.
They assemble about once a year, to the number of
from forty to fifty. Though it is not often that
business is submitted to their deliberations, they are
addressed by the Rajah on subjects of general interest,
and are afterwards invited to dine at the Palace. It
is a decided step in advance that this meeting of
native and European officers should take place, as it
tends to efface local prejudices, and to consolidate the
Government. This General Council was not summoned
during the lifetime of Sir James Brooke,
though he often talked of doing so, and would have
carried out his intention had he lived.</p>

<p>The country is divided into five chief districts
under English Residents: Sarawak Proper, Batang
Lupar, Rejang, Baram and Limbang. In each
of these there are also several assistants to look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
after the management of the sub-districts. All
these officers hold courts, but there is an appeal from
the findings of the junior officers to the Resident
of the district, and all very serious sentences are
ultimately referred to the capital for the Rajah’s
decision or approval. From the reports in the
<cite>Gazette</cite>, I gather that very substantial justice is
administered. The notions of equity entertained by
some of the junior officers may be rather crude;
but the power of appeal enables anyone who is
dissatisfied with a sentence to refer the matter to
the Resident, and the natives often make use of
this privilege with results satisfactory to themselves.</p>

<p>The Government of Sarawak is a kind of mild
despotism, the only government suitable to Asiatics,
who look to their chief as the sole depositary of
supreme power. The influence of the old Rajah still
pervades the whole system, and native and European
work together in perfect harmony. Though the
head of each district is an Englishman, every effort
is made to employ the natives in responsible positions,
as collectors of revenue, as judges with the Rajah
or the Residents in the superior courts, as sole judges
in the native tribunals, which try all cases where
their religion or racial customs are affected, and
as chiefs of the different tribes and local communities,
and, on the whole, the results appear to be satisfactory.</p>

<p>The old Rajah used to write that the development
of native states must be slow in order to be permanent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
and the development of Sarawak has been very
slow, slower than most people would have expected,
as the introduction of steamers on the coast pointed
to more rapid progress.</p>

<p>Agriculture is the mainstay of every Asiatic
country. In the early years of the old Rajah’s
Government the natives only grew rice sufficient for
their own consumption, and the Chinese confined
themselves to a little gardening near their small
settlements; but when, in 1850, the Chinese flocked
from Sambas into Sarawak, Captain Brooke saw the
necessity of encouraging as many as possible of those
accustomed to agriculture to settle on the fertile
soil near the river’s banks, and began by establishing
colonies of these industrious immigrants at places about
eight miles above the capital, at Sungei Tungah and
Batu Kawa. These flourished until the year 1857,
when the Chinese insurrection interfered with their
progress for a time.</p>

<p>The financial distress which followed this great
upheaval prevented any further assistance being
given to agriculturists, until, in 1875, the present
Rajah, Sir Charles Brooke, determined to encourage
gambier planting, and this he followed up by introducing
the cultivation of pepper, coffee, including the
Liberian variety, cocoa and the oil palm. Of these
coffee appears the most popular among the Malays
and Dyaks, who have carried its cultivation into most
of the districts of Sarawak, on a small scale, it is true,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
but as the plants bear, and the returns come in,
many more are now encouraged to cultivate this useful
shrub.</p>

<p>Only one English Planting Company tried its
fortune in the country, and this failed for want of
capital to enable it to await results. In 1895, 500
cwts. of coffee were exported, whilst in 1896 the
export rose to 1483 cwts., nearly treble the amount,
and there is every probability that the annual produce
will proportionally increase; gambier rose from 26,250
cwts. in 1895 to 29,285 cwts. in 1896; and pepper, a
very valuable article, was exported in both years to the
amount of over 18,000 cwts. These three important
cultivations were introduced into the country by
the present Rajah, and their products were valued in
1895 at £46,820, and in 1896 at £44,082.</p>

<p>The planting of sago, an indigenous palm, has been
much encouraged, and the export of the manufactured
flour in 1896 amounted to over 15,000 tons, of a
value of about £70,000. A little tea is grown but
is not exported. There is no doubt that the Sarawak
Government has done much to encourage agriculture,
but it has failed as yet to attract European
capital. I notice that lately the Borneo Company
has commenced to plant gambier. One of the causes
of the failure above referred to is, that European
capitalists are not tempted by the prospect of having
their enterprises under the control of an irresponsible
ruler, however just and capable he may be, as all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
might change on the advent of a successor. But they
might reflect that the Borneo Company have been
carrying on their business for the last forty years
without any difficulties arising.</p>

<p>There are millions of acres in the Sarawak territory
which are open to European capitalists; hundreds of
thousands of acres on the great river of Rejang alone,
where water carriage would be at their door, and
produce could be shipped direct to Europe, and that
is only one out of the many districts awaiting foreign
enterprise.</p>

<p>It is curious that an agricultural population like
that of Sarawak does not grow sufficient rice for its
own consumption. In 1896 it had to import of this
grain to the value of about £42,000. It is true that
only a portion of the population is really industrious—the
Chinese and the Seribas and Sakarang Dyaks.
The former are otherwise employed, whilst the latter
devote much of their energy to the collection of
jungle produce. And yet in the district of Samarahan
alone sufficient rice might be cultivated to supply
the whole country.</p>

<p>If we compare the trade returns of Sarawak for the
years 1876 and 1896, and take only the dollar value,
the increase is striking, but if you turn the amounts
into sterling the results are very disappointing. In
1876 the exchange value of the dollar was four
shillings, whilst in 1896 it had fallen to two shillings
only. This depreciation of silver certainly aids those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
countries where the dollar and rupee circulate by the
great nominal augmentation of the value of their produce,
whilst it enhances the price of European goods
by a hundred per cent. when paid for in silver.</p>

<p>These figures may relate principally to the trade of
Sarawak Proper, as each of the large districts has a
small direct trade with Singapore, but the indications
are to the contrary, as the coal exported from Sadong
is included in these returns, and the sago flour from
some at least of the out-stations.</p>

<p>The export of antimony has fallen off considerably,
and cinnabar has been nearly worked out. Jungle
produce continues to be found in large quantities,
and gutta-percha, India rubber, rattans, beeswax and
timber considerably swell the trade returns; but coal
and gold are, I think, destined to develop Sarawak
in a remarkable manner. The Borneo Company,
which until lately had not been able to invest much
capital in their operations on account of the difficulties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
attending the first working of coal in Sarawak, as a
result of the scarcity of antimony and the gradual
failure of the great deposits of cinnabar, has now
entered on a new phase of activity.</p>

<p>Gold has been known to exist for many years.
Even on the arrival of the first Rajah, the Chinese
were working it on a small scale, but only in the
alluvial deposits. I was with the late Dr MacDougall,
Bishop of Sarawak, when, in 1854, he picked up a
piece of quartz with specks of gold distinctly visible
in it, but it was not until many years later that great
reefs of gold-bearing quartz were discovered, and
although good results were obtained in the laboratory,
the industry could not then be worked on a commercial
basis. Lately, however, the Borneo Company has
found that by the cyanide process it can make the
working of the stone pay, and it has now erected
very extensive and elaborate machinery, which, when
in full operation, will crush three hundred tons of
quartz a day. This will be the salvation of Sarawak,
for there is no reason, if the working of the present
plant prove a mercantile success, why a dozen similar
establishments should not be erected, as the stone is
practically inexhaustible, the reefs having been traced
for about thirty miles. The latest reports from Sarawak
show that the machinery is doing well in the Company’s
establishment at Bauh, and so satisfied are the directors
with the results that they are putting up a considerable
plant at Bidi, where the quartz is richer in quality.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
Both these places are in the interior of Sarawak
Proper.</p>

<p>The benefit to Sarawak will be twofold, as the
Government is to receive five per cent. of the gold
produced, and large numbers of Chinese, whom the
Company finds can alone be relied on for regular operations,
must be imported to work the plant and quarry
the stone. The ‘farms’ and the import duties will benefit
by this influx of labour, and it may enable the Sarawak
Government ultimately to abolish all export duties on
agricultural produce. We used to reckon that each
Chinaman on an average increased the revenue by
two pounds sterling per annum.</p>

<p>The washing for gold by the Chinese in the
alluvial soil has not for many years proved very
productive; in fact, it has been thought that the
discontent of the Chinese, before the great insurrection
of 1857, arose partly from the fact that the gold
workings did not pay, and the coolies began to look
with suspicion on the integrity of their chiefs.</p>

<p>Coal, though worked for many years, produced at
first no practical results, but in 1896 nearly 23,000
tons were exported, and the amount increased greatly
during 1897 and 1898. This also must affect the
revenue both directly and indirectly in a very satisfactory
manner.</p>

<p>The only factories which have proved successful
in Sarawak are those that produce sago flour. These
will doubtless increase, as in many places the natives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
have for several years past augmented their plantations,
and it is a cultivation which suits their indolent habits,
for after tending the young plants during the first
year, little or no care is subsequently given to the
palm trees.</p>

<p>The population of Sarawak is very varied. In all
its districts, with the exception of the Milanau rivers
and Baram, there is an indigenous Malay population,
who are born traders and fishermen, and only cultivate
as it were under protest, but they do grow a
little rice, a few rough vegetables, and lately some
have made small coffee gardens. As a rule they
neglect the last, or overcrowd the plants with other
products.</p>

<p>In Sarawak, Samarahan and Sadong the interior is
inhabited by Land Dyaks, a very primitive race, who
are, however, slowly advancing, while some, as those
in Samarahan, must be getting rich, as a Resident
reports seeing the girls dancing in silks and brocades,
with strings of silver dollars hanging round their
waists. It was a pleasure to read of this advance, as
many previous accounts had pointed to a great deterioration
in their condition.</p>

<p>But the pride of Sarawak must always be the Sea
Dyaks who live on the Batang Lupar, the Seribas and
the right-hand branches of the Rejang. These were
the destructive pirates of the coast, who put to sea in
large fleets of fast vessels, and ravaged every district
they could reach. When the expeditions of Captains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
Keppel and Farquhar had put down their piracies at
sea, and the land operations, principally conducted by
the present Rajah, then chief Resident on the Batang
Lupar, had subdued them in the interior, they began
to look to other fields of activity. Even as early as
1853 I sent a report home about their energetic work
in the antimony mines. Now, they are the most industrious
of the collectors of jungle produce, and
have spread wherever that is to be found, whether in
the interior of the Rejang, Baram, or Limbang districts.
One hears of them also in the territories of the British
North Borneo Company, where they should be
welcome immigrants, not only on account of their
industry, but of their readiness to support the established
Government. Owing to this last amiable trait
in their character they have been recalled by the Sarawak
Government under the penalty, in case of disobedience,
of being declared outlaws. This was a
mistake, as they would be equally useful to the North
Borneo Company, which is combating lawlessness as
much as the Sarawak Government, and among a far
more dangerous population. In looking over my Sarawak
correspondence I find that they were accused of
acting against the regulations of the Company, particularly
in the interior of Padas, but this appears to
have arisen from the foolish restrictions placed on the
Dyaks and others by the subordinate officers in that
district, which were strongly condemned by the Resident
at Labuan, the late Mr Maxwell, a man of remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
intelligence and experience, the latter acquired
when in the Sarawak service.</p>

<p>These Sea Dyaks even ventured across the China
Sea, and sought for jungle produce throughout the
Malay Peninsula, but I hear that they also have been
recalled, why or wherefore it is difficult even to guess.
In reading through these <cite>Gazettes</cite>, I have come across
references to a Dyak selling gutta-percha in Singapore
for $1200; to another having disposed of produce in
the bazaar to the amount of $1500; and to a prahu
being swamped with $2000 worth of goods or cash on
board. These Dyaks are indeed a valuable population.</p>

<p>The next to be noticed are the Milanaus, who live
at the mouths of the rivers Rejang, Oya and Muka,
and are apparently a race apart. They are perhaps a
little more industrious than the Malays, and devote
themselves to planting and roughly manufacturing
sago. A portion of this population has been converted
to Mohammedanism, whilst the rest cannot bring
themselves to abandon pork.</p>

<p>In the far interior of the Rejang, the Bintulu, and all
through the Baram districts, are the numerous tattooed
tribes, as the Kayans and the Kineahs; the mongrel
villagers called Kanowits; and the wildest of wild tribes,
the Punans and Pakatans. As yet none of these tribes
have made their mark either in the field of battle or in
any industry, except in the working of iron ores or
their products, but it is comparatively lately that they
have come under the influence of the English. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
Sarawak Government appears to have a very intelligent
Resident in Baram, Mr Hose.</p>

<p>The Chinese will no doubt gradually fill up the
different districts of Sarawak, but the progress is slow.
They do not seem to take kindly to Borneo in general,
probably because wages are low, the native seldom
receiving more than twenty-five cents or sixpence a
day, though the wages of the Chinese are doubtless
considerably higher. In many villages, however, where
they are permitted to settle, you will be sure to find
Chinese shopkeepers, who carry on a thriving trade.
They have the reputation of not being very honest
dealers, as false weights are too often resorted to, in
order to enable them to pay a price nominally higher
than the market rate, which renders fair competition
impossible. I could never understand why
restrictions were so often placed on their settlement
among the interior tribes, except where the Dyaks
themselves objected to their presence. It is true they
are not very honest, but in my time we found the
natives a match for them in this line, as they used to
insert stones into the large lumps of gutta-percha. As
might be expected from the low class of Chinese who
immigrate into Sarawak, the principal occupants of the
prisons are found among their ranks.</p>

<p>Limbang and Trusan, to the north of the Sultan’s
capital, are the latest acquisitions of Sarawak. They
contain a mixed population of Kadayans, Muruts and
Bisayas, with no very marked characteristics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>I am loath to write anything which may appear as
an adverse criticism of the conduct of the present
Rajah, with whom I have been friends for over fifty
years, but unless we are to adopt the principle that ‘the
end justifies the means,’ it is difficult to approve the
action of Sarawak in seizing by force any part of the
Sultan’s dominions. A little gentle, persevering diplomacy
would have secured Limbang without violating
any principle of international law. I am convinced,
however, that the present Rajah was deceived by
someone as to the political position of that district,
as he wrote that, for four years previous to his action,
Limbang was completely independent of the Sultan,
which his officers subsequently found was not the case.</p>

<p>The Sultan is the Suzerain Lord of all the possessions
of the present Rajah, with the doubtful exception
of Sarawak Proper, and Great Britain is the Protector
of Sarawak and Brunei alike, yet the Sarawak <cite>Gazette</cite>,
the official organ of its Government, thus refers to the
Brunei under British protection: ‘Brunei has long been
a disgrace, a blot on the map of Borneo. There murder
and robbery thrive, and criminals from all around find
a refuge from the punishment merited by their evil
deeds, with the knowledge and sanction of the Sultan,
and under the protection of the British flag.’</p>

<p>To use an expressive, but not very elegant, phrase,
the writer has ‘let the cat out of the bag.’ It is probably
true that the British Government would not
permit Sarawak to seize Brunei and depose the Sultan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
but there are other and more peaceful means of putting
an end to Brunei, if it be the sink of iniquity described.
Already the Kadayans are taking up their permanent
residence in Baram under the Sarawak flag, and many
Borneans and Kadayans are moving to Limbang; while
a certain number have already established themselves
in Padas under the flag of the North Borneo Company.
By degrees the population of the capital will
completely disperse and settle in the surrounding
districts, and the capital will cease to exist as a
centre of authority.</p>

<p>That the inhabitants of Limbang rejoiced to be
placed under the protection of the Sarawak flag there
can be no doubt. I knew them well, and how they
suffered from the exactions of the Pangerans and their
rapacious followers, and no one would have more
rejoiced than myself to hear they had been put under
Sarawak rule in a less forcible way. As poverty increased
in Brunei, so had the exactions augmented,
and Limbang, being near, suffered the most. Perhaps
some of my readers may think that in this case ‘the
end <em>did</em> justify the means.’ At all events, that appears
to have been the view taken by our own Foreign Office.</p>

<p>As far as I can judge from the notices in the
Sarawak <cite>Gazette</cite>, and from my private correspondence,
neither the Missions nor education have made
much progress, though there are schools at the
capital, and both the Anglicans and the Roman
Catholics have establishments in the country. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
Mission schools appear to educate from two to three
hundred pupils, but little is evidently done at the
out-stations, and the Dyaks in general are left to
themselves, although at one time the field appeared
most promising. I fear that the explanation is that
the true missionary spirit is dead in our Church. It is
no longer looked upon as a field for talent, and those
who would not pass muster in an English parish are
sent off to vegetate in a Bornean out-station, where
their influence is <em>nil</em>.</p>

<p>I notice it reported in a private letter that the
Catholic Mission is the more prosperous, as it appears
to be well provided with money, erects substantial
buildings, and has a very competent staff.</p>

<p>How little the influence of European rule touches
the inner life and belief of the native, whatever may
be his race! I remember being in Singapore at the
time the Government was building a new church,
when it was reported that the convicts were seizing
people at night and murdering them in order to bury
their heads under the foundations of the new building.
A panic prevailed for a considerable time, and natives
only ventured out in strong parties. And this occurred
in a British settlement after our Government had
been established there over thirty years. I discussed
this unaccountable panic with my Chinese butler,
who spoke English well, and had lived all his life in
European families. His only answer to my repeated
questions was that he hoped it was not true, that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
did not know, but he understood it was generally
believed. Our missionaries in China have the same
experience.</p>

<p>Another intelligent native remarked that the
English must have been a barbarous race, as formerly
they sacrificed a human victim every time they prepared
to take the sacrament, but that in more
modern days they had become more civilised, as
they now only sacrificed dogs, a reference to the
periodical destruction in British settlements of all
stray animals. What a perverse interpretation of
missionary teaching!</p>

<p>After fifty years of English rule in Sarawak a similar
panic occurred. I will quote the Sarawak <cite>Gazette</cite>
of September 1, 1894: ‘Some months back a most
unaccountable scare took possession of the Asiatic
population of Sarawak Proper—Malays, Chinese,
Dyaks and others being similarly affected. It was at
first rumoured that the Government required human
heads to place under the foundations of the new high
level reservoir at the waterworks, and that men were
sent out at night to procure these.... Other
equally absurd stories followed and were fully believed,
many natives going so far as to assert that they had
met with these head hunters about the native town
at night. The people no longer ventured out after
dark; coolies whose work would preclude their return
to their own homes at night were unobtainable, not
a boat could be obtained to cross the river after dark,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
and the majority of persons whose business took
them further than the limits of the bazaar, carried
arms.’</p>

<p>The entire article is too long to quote; the panic
spread all along the coast, invaded the Dutch territories,
and found its way to the furthest out-stations.
Numerous murders were really committed, and at
first the natives were afraid to report them. Gradually,
however, people came to their senses, but only to
fall into another panic, on the ground that robbers
were wandering under the Malay houses, which are
built on piles, and stabbing at the inmates from below.
A few deaths from this cause did, in fact, occur,
which gave an excuse for the alarm, and some
ingenious thieves bored holes through boxes resting
on the floor and extracted their contents. It must be
remembered that these floors are not of planks, but
of laths of the nibong palm with interstices between
them, and are generally covered over with matting.</p>

<p>It is almost incredible that people who had been
governed by the old Rajah and his successor, and
governed in the most benevolent and generous manner
for over fifty years, should have believed that their
rulers could be capable of seeking their heads to bury
under the foundations of the new waterworks. It
appears as if there were no common ground on which
the intellect of the white and coloured races can meet;
they never understand us and we shall probably never
fully understand them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>Finance has never been the strong point of the
Sarawak Government.</p>

<p>The treasurer’s financial statement for the year,
1896, is too full of trivial details to be satisfactory,
but the tables which are published in the same number
of the <cite>Gazette</cite> enable one to form a very clear idea of
the financial state of the country.</p>

<p>The ‘farms’ are the most important source of revenue,
and those that are legitimate are the opium and spirit
farms; the gambling farm is no doubt suitable to the
Chinese, and discourages play among the Malays and
Dyaks. But the objectionable farms are the pork,
the fish and the pawnbroking. The pork farm was
abolished in 1896, as it was found to restrict the supply
of good meat, and raise its price to the industrious
Chinese labourer, who could only obtain an inferior
article, while it brought in but little to the revenue.
The Government slaughter-houses are as profitable,
and do not interfere so much with trade. The
<cite>Gazette</cite> notices that after the abolition of this farm
the supply of meat became more plentiful, and was of a
much finer quality, with a reduction in price. The fish
market is equally objectionable. The monopolists pay
so poorly for the supply, that, according to the <cite>Gazette</cite>,
the fishermen earned less than fourpence a day, whilst
the price of fish was so raised that the Government imposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
a maximum; but this paternal measure did not
answer, and it was repealed. The fish farm should go
the way of the pork farm. There are also obvious
objections to a pawnbroking farm. A system of licenses
would pay better, and be much less liable to abuse.</p>

<p>Though the export duties on agricultural produce
are light, they are unsound in principle, interfere
with trade, and lessen the profit of the industrious
steady planter; and they only bring in about £2500
a year. It would be better to add to the list of
imports subject to duty. The probate duties are quite
unsuited to a half or quarter civilised people, and must
render the Residents unpopular with the best of the
population. No sooner is the news received of the
death of a Dyak chief than the nearest English
officer has to start off to the spot to see that the
Government dues are not evaded, and the wages, or
their equivalent, of the boat’s crew must often exceed
the amount received. There is another tax which
checks what might become a considerable industry—the
duty on salt. This prevents any real development
of the extensive fisheries of the coast, as not only is
a necessary product taxed, but a duty is also raised
on the exported salted fish, which has thus to bear a
double weight. A bounty might be granted equivalent
to the amount of the duty on the salt used. The
stamp duty has only lately been imposed, and may
possibly be useful in the administration of justice, but
it will have to be worked with very great caution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>If the Borneo Company succeed with their new
gold working machinery, and there is no apparent
reason why they should not do so, the increase in
the revenues may enable the Rajah to do away with
or modify those taxes and duties, which impede
commerce and hinder the progress of the country.
It must have been uphill work to carry on the
Government with revenues so inelastic.</p>

<p>When I first arrived in Sarawak I do not think
the cattle exceeded a dozen, and these were at a
place about fourteen miles above the capital, and were
very much neglected. At present we find cattle at
every station, and English bulls are often imported to
improve the breed. The natives also in several
districts have cattle of their own, and under gentle
pressure are paying more attention to them. I do
not remember that during my long residence in
Sarawak we had beef even once a year.</p>

<p>The Sarawak courts are not influenced by maudlin
pity, and punish by heavy fines all those who by carelessness,
or any action of their own, cause the death
or wounding of any human being. Many casualties
are said to occur from men supposing that a noise
in the brushwood was caused by a wild beast, and
firing at once and thus slaying a fellow hunter; these
never escape deserved punishment. The setting of
traps to kill pig or deer often caused the infliction of
injuries or even death on the unwary, and the setter
suffered in consequence. I wish this system of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
punishing wanton carelessness were introduced into
English practice. We might then hear of fewer cases
of criminally careless people presenting guns at their
friends, and, when a fatal result follows, saying glibly
that they thought the weapon was not loaded.</p>

<p>In outlying stations, the killing for the purpose of
securing heads would have been a very constant
practice had not the present Rajah sternly resolved to
insist on the death penalty whenever the culprits
belonged to tribes who thoroughly understood the
law; whilst upon others who had but recently come
under the sway of Sarawak, and were still almost in
the savage state, he was content to impose heavy
fines. This judicious administration of justice is
having a very salutary effect, and will gradually extinguish
the evil.</p>

<p>It sounds curious to read of both parties in a
case being fined, but very often both are to blame in a
greater or less degree, and are punished in proportion.
But what must have taxed a Resident’s gravity was the
hearing a case of two privates in the Sarawak Rangers,
accused of working a charm, in order to compass the
death of an ex-comrade, and fining the victim as well
as the culprits.</p>

<p>The Rajah is kept well informed as to what passes
throughout his extensive territories, as he insists on
the Residents and Assistant Residents sending monthly
reports of all occurrences in each of their districts, and
I understand that every one of them also keeps a diary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
of events. This methodical system must be very
useful to the Government. The reports from Baram
and Limbang are especially interesting, and I could
have wished them fuller.</p>

<p>For the information of those who may desire to
enter the Sarawak service, or are interested in the
subject, I will mention the salaries which were fixed
from January 1, 1898. I may premise by saying
that I have taken the dollar to represent two shillings,
the exchange value, but that by no means represents
its local value, as prices and wages in dollars have not
increased in anything like the proportion of the fall
in the exchange. In some cases wages do not
appear to have increased much since my time,
when the dollar was always worth more than four
shillings.</p>

<p>The treasurer, second-class Residents and medical
officer have also allowances, the amount of which is
not stated; military commandant, etc., according to
respective agreements. Of course, to turn these
salaries into dollars you have only to multiply by
ten.</p>

<p>The terms for furlough pay are very liberal, leave
being generally granted on full pay, and the dollar
valued at four shillings. Pensions are given, after
thirty years’ service, at the same rate of exchange,
half pay for life—furloughs in Europe not included.</p>

<p>I have remarked before how difficult it is to
induce English ladies to associate with natives, but
I have heard that the Ranee, Lady Brooke, has been
in the habit of visiting the Malay ladies and receiving
their visits in return, and I noticed in one
of the <cite>Gazettes</cite> that Mrs Maxwell, the wife of the
late chief Resident, gave an elaborate picnic to the
daughters of the principal Malays. This is as it
should be, and must have a good effect. It is interesting
to read that cricket has been introduced among
the native lads, and that some of them take to it with
zest.</p>

<p>I have noticed an occasional remark in the <cite>Gazette</cite>
on the hostility displayed by Singapore towards Sarawak.
That there was in Sir James Brooke’s time a
great jealousy both of Sarawak and Labuan there can
be no doubt. It was founded on a foolish idea that
these two places might become centres of independent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
trade with Europe to the detriment of Singapore.
The far-seeing knew that it would not be so,
and that instead of being rivals they would become
feeders of our great free-trade port, but it would seem
that among a few of the narrow-minded this jealousy
still exists.</p>

<p>Among the dangers to life in Sarawak are the
crocodiles or alligators. Some naturalists declare that
one of the two species—I believe the latter—is not
found in Asia, but I think that those who have had
the measurement of those reptiles, to estimate the
amount of reward for their destruction, must have
noticed that there are apparently two species—one
very broad in the head, the other very long and
narrow. It is true we never examined their teeth,
by which we might have distinguished them. It is
said on good authority that there is a third species
only found in fresh water, living for preference in
the deep pools of the far inland reaches of the rivers.
Sir Hugh Low saw them in the interior of the Rejang,
and I often heard of them in Sarawak. I remarked
to a native chief that it was curious that this species
should have fixed its habitat away from the deep
water. ‘Not more curious,’ he answered, ‘than seeing
you white men in Borneo.’</p>

<p>Whatever the true name of these brutes may be,
the destruction of life traceable to them is considerable.
They seize people bathing on the banks of
rivers, catch unwary children, and snatch people from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
their canoes. They will often swim on the surface
of the water with their victims in their mouths, and
the <cite>Gazette</cite> mentions one instance where the alligator
appeared with the body on the second day.
As they are called alligators in Borneo, I will not
change their name.</p>

<p>Many a tale of quiet heroism may be told connected
with these attacks. One day a mother and
daughter were paddling up the Linga river, when
the former was snatched from the boat by an alligator.
It did not attempt to sink with its victim, which gave
time to the daughter to spring on its neck, and, leaning
forward, she gouged out the eyes of the reptile,
which instantly let go the mother and dived to the
bottom of the stream. I have known of several instances
of these heroic attempts to save relations.</p>

<p>There was an alligator which created a panic
among all those who had to pull by the entrance
of the Siol stream on the Sarawak river, so many
had been its victims. It was ultimately taken, and
measured, it is said, over twenty-four feet in length.</p>

<p>When I was living in Brunei a similar panic
occurred. So many people were snatched from their
boats that there was talk of a crusade being undertaken
against the alligator which caused it. But as
that did not come off, I proposed to my six boatmen
that we should attempt the destruction of the brute.
I armed my men with muskets, and I took for my
own use a Minié rifle. We arranged that I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
have first shot, and if I missed, they were to fire a
volley at the enemy. We pulled down quietly to
the haunted spot, and then floated with the stream.
We had not been there many minutes when my
head man said, ‘There he is.’ I looked round, and
all I could see were a pair of prominent eyes, a broad
forehead and a streak of its back. It was coming
at us with all its speed. I waited until it was within
about twenty-five yards, and then fired. The heavy
ball struck it between the eyes, then bounded off,
and fell into the water many a yard away. There
was great commotion as the alligator dived beneath
the surface. My men, who had wonderfully sharp
eyes, said that the bullet had torn the skin off the
forehead, and that the beast must die, as the worms
with which these waters swarm would get into the
wound. A week or two subsequently, some fishermen
told me they had seen an immense alligator, at
least twenty feet in length, lying on the mud bank
of a small stream. All the flesh on its head and neck
was rotting away, and it was evidently nearly dead,
as it scarcely moved on their approach. At all events,
the man-eater never appeared again. The largest
alligator which I ever measured myself was only
seventeen feet six inches long, but Sir Hugh Low
tells me that he has himself measured one which
touched twenty-six feet in length.</p>

<p>I think it highly probable that hunger has driven
the alligators to be as aggressive as they have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
during the last few years. When the rinderpest was
killing cattle in the Malay Peninsula, some similar
disease attacked the wild pigs, and they died by
hundreds. About the same time a like mortality
occurred in Borneo. The principal food of the alligator
is the wild pig, which is taken whilst swimming
across the rivers in search of jungle fruits. When
the pest occurred this supply of pork was much
lessened, and the alligators became more voracious.</p>

<p>The wild animals in Sarawak must be rapidly disappearing
as cultivation and population increase, and
also as a ready market is found for venison. Wild
pig and various species of deer are the only animals
which were ever plentiful in Sarawak. In its last
acquired districts, however, such as Baram and Limbang,
there are large herds of wild cattle—splendid
beasts.</p>

<p>This account of the present condition of Sarawak
I feel to be very meagre, but I have been unable to
obtain any information except from the <cite>Gazette</cite>,
which, being written for a special purpose, only enters
into the minor details required to keep the superior
officers informed of what is passing in the interior
and at the out-stations.</p>

<p>If the old Rajah could see the present state of his
adopted country, he would have every reason to be
proud of the results of his work, for although it has
not become what he hoped—a second Java—it is
progressing. As the present Rajah, Sir Charles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
Brooke, was brought up to his work under the old
influences, he has carried out the views and projects
of his uncle in a very satisfactory manner, and it is
only to be hoped that whenever his son may succeed
him he may be thoroughly imbued with those traditions
which have secured the success of one of the
most striking enterprises of modern times.</p>

<p>The old Rajah relied entirely for his position in
Borneo on the support of the natives themselves, and
the present Rajah does nearly the same.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> They both
had a corps of English officers (civilians) to aid them
in governing the country, but the military forces are
purely native, and these also constitute the bulk of
the civilian employés, from the Datus, those valued
members of the Supreme Council, to the humblest
policeman. The more one reflects on the subject the
more one is disposed to admire the system which has
produced a unique Government, the like of which
has never been seen before. But whilst we admire
the system introduced by the old Rajah, we must not
forget those who have so admirably carried it out, at
the head of whom is the present Rajah, with his staff
of trustworthy assistants.</p>

<p class="no-indent">To complete the survey of those countries, which,
through the policy of Rajah Brooke, were ultimately
brought under the influence and protection of
England, I must devote a chapter to the British
North Borneo Company.</p>

<p>There is nothing grander or more lovely than the
country which lies between our colony of Labuan and
Marudu Bay, on the extreme north of the great
island. I have sailed many times along that beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
coast, and have been lost in admiration at the variety
of its scenery, from the soft outline of its well-wooded
shores to the succession of ranges of undulating hills
which form the background, until all are dwarfed
by the magnificent mountain of Kina Balu, which
towers above them.</p>

<p>In our journeys towards this lofty mountain, Sir
Hugh Low and I passed through a great variety of
country. Our first expedition took us from Abai Bay
across a cultivated plain to the interior of the Tampasuk
river, the low land extending for many miles on
either side of the path we followed, and stretching
for an indefinite distance ahead of us. Here the
natives ride the water buffaloes, the oxen, the bulls and
cows as they do horses in other countries. We took
up our quarters for the night in the substantial house
of a Bajau chief, an old friend of my fellow traveller,
and next day we started inland, riding for many hours
over a slightly undulating plain, which continued to the
foot of the ranges of hills in front. We occasionally
passed pretty villages, shaded by dense clumps of cocoanut
palms and mango trees. The scene was magnificent.
When we reached the first low range the path
became stony and very rough, so that we had to give up
our horses and trust to our own feet, and most enjoyable
days they were, as we advanced along the banks
of the Tampasuk, through fertile fields in full cultivation,
the only inconvenience our having so constantly
to ford the river. At length we turned from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
the stream, climbing a steepish hill to the extensive
village of Kiau, which is built on a sloping buttress
of Kina Balu, about three thousand feet above the level
of the sea.</p>

<p>On our next visit to the mountain we started from
Gaya Bay, then across the lake-like Mengkabong
river, and after riding over a well-cultivated plain we
climbed to the summit of the first range of hills, and
then followed the ridges towards the mountain. Nothing
could have been finer than the scenery. There
was no forest, of which in Borneo one sometimes
gets tired; all the land was either under cultivation
or had been cultivated, ideal spots for
coffee plantations if the soil be suitable. We
continued on the high land until we reached the
Tampasuk river, when we followed the same path
as we had taken on our previous journey. The
weeks we spent on the great mountain were weeks
of pleasure, and we explored many of its buttresses,
and at length climbed again to its summit. Mr
Alfred Wallace used to say that it was worth the
journey to Borneo in order to eat the fresh fruit of
the Durian, but I think the fatigues of the long
voyage would be amply repaid by a visit to
this lovely coast and an excursion to its great
mountain.</p>

<p>On one occasion we pitched our tents for a
time on the western slope of Kina Balu, about five
thousand feet above the sea, on a spot which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
fairly level for half a mile in length by a quarter in
breadth. There were but few trees, the ground being
rocky, but the stony surface was covered by beautiful
nepenthes plants, with purple pitchers, which held as
much as two quarts of water. From this elevation
we could see over the ranges of hills we had passed in
our journeys, the reaches of many rivers, the Tampasuk
plain to the China Sea beyond. It would be a
perfect site for a sanatorium. Roads would have to be
made, then invalids and others would come to enjoy
the healthy breezes, and gain strength to make excursions
over the mountain. Forty years ago I recommended
the Government of India to send the least
guilty of their mutineers to the north-west coast,
where they would have opened up a splendid country,
and our camping ground would have furnished space
for the barracks required for a garrison of English
troops.</p>

<p>In these days when mountaineers are seeking new
worlds to conquer, it may interest them to read the
following short description of our first joint expedition
to Kina Balu. To ascend this splendid peak has, no
doubt, been the desire of all those who have looked
upon its noble proportions. Seen from the north-west, no
grander effect can be conceived, as it rises sheer out of
the plain and sweeps aloft until it attains the towering
height of nearly fourteen thousand feet. Its grand
precipices, its polished granite surfaces, glittering under
the bright tropical rays, the dashing cascades which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
fall from a height so great that they dissolve in spray
before they are lost in the dark valleys below, have a
magical effect on the imagination, and I felt a longing,
scarcely to be conceived, to explore its unknown
beauties. No amount of fatigue, no suffering, no
opposition could stop us when once we started from
the coast, and the first time I reached the summit, it
was with bare feet that left a red tinge on the rocks
at every step. But all this was unnoticed as I viewed
the grandeur of the scene around, the lofty peaks of
every varied form, the magnificent slopes of apparently
polished granite, the broad terraces, the cyclopean
walls fringing the giddy precipices, the chasms,
whose depths the eye could not penetrate. There
was nothing that stopped our onward march, and
no rest was sought until we reached the solitary
southern peak and I had climbed to its very pinnacle,
and rested on a spot not a yard in breadth.
Then, and only then, did the glow of triumph
mantle in my cheeks as my eyes rested with satisfaction
on the vast panorama spread out below. Unfortunately
misty clouds swept round the mountain
obscuring the splendour of the scene, but they lent a
powerful aid to the imagination, as through the rents
in the fleecy curtain, rivers, mountains and villages
were now visible, now hidden. And there, looking
south, in the distance high above all, with nothing
but the thin air between, rose another peak, so lofty
that it was impossible to estimate its distance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
In that rarefied air remote objects appear near, and
the voice can be heard without an effort through
a space which in the plains below it could not
penetrate.</p>

<p>I had never before attained so great a height, and
never before had I seen such flowers so brilliant and
so numerous. There were rhododendrons of the
brightest scarlet, or blood colour, or rosy pink, in
bunches of forty blossoms, covering trees twenty feet
in height. And not single trees, but masses of
rhododendrons in sheltered nooks, literally bending
beneath the weight of their flowers. And how
marvellous were the shapes of the nepenthes, how
beautiful in colour, how delicate in form!</p>

<p>Fourteen thousand feet does not appear very lofty
for a mountain, but from the north-west you see the
whole gigantic form without the intervention of other
summits. In Bolivia I have looked at heights rising
to over twenty-five thousand feet, but you observe them
from plains twelve thousand feet above the sea; in
Mexico, the highest volcano reaches to about nineteen
thousand feet, but then it is usually seen from
the capital, itself at seven thousand five hundred
feet; and the same with the highest European
mountains.</p>

<p>Sir Hugh Low and I were for many years the only
real explorers of these mountains, and I feel a sort
of paternal interest in the British North Borneo
Company, as Sir Alfred Dent once informed me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
that it was my work, <cite>Life in the Forests of the Far
East</cite>, which first suggested the idea of acquiring the
north-west coast for a governing and developing
company.</p>

<p>The north-west coast possesses two very important
harbours. Gaya Bay has often been recommended
as a naval station to command the China Seas. It
certainly offers every facility, and would be a port of
refuge in war time for our mercantile marine. In
many respects, however, the Port of Labuan is more
suitable for all purposes, as it not only has an excellent
anchorage easily defended, but it is well supplied with
coal from mines on the island itself, and is opposite
the terminus of the trans-Bornean railway, now in
course of construction, which would bring down full
supplies of cattle and provisions from the fertile districts
of Padas and Kalias. It has also the advantage
of having the whole of Brunei Bay enclosed by territory
under English protection, with the Sarawak
Government coal mines at Muara, and the productive
rivers of Limbang and Trusan to add to
its supplies.</p>

<p>Labuan is administered, with the sanction of our
Government, by the British North Borneo Company,
and is likely to be one of the most flourishing of its
possessions, as it is not only connected by telegraph
lines with Singapore and Hong Kong, a through British
line, but it must increase in consequence in these days
of wars and rumours of wars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>Sir Alfred Dent acquired through an agent the
concession of the north-west coast of Borneo from
the Sultan of Brunei, though with some important
exceptions, now in process of being handed over
to the Company, as well as the north-east coast,
which during the last century had been ceded to
England by a Sultan of Sulu, but which we had left
unoccupied; all necessary arrangements were made
with the government of those islands. These concessions
were first worked by a Provisional Association,
and were, in 1881, taken over by the newly-formed
North Borneo Company on very onerous terms,
which, at the present day, it would be useless to
criticise, but which left the directors with insufficient
working capital to push development with any
vigour.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to trace in any detail the history
of the Company during the last seventeen years. My
object being rather to give a general view of its
present condition. I may remark, however, to
account for its still backward state, that its progress
was much impeded by a want of knowledge, on the
part of both the chairman and the directors, of the
country they were chosen to administer. Within these
last few years this defect has been rectified, and
we may now confidently expect that progress will
be more rapid.</p>

<p>The north-east coast of Borneo presents a great
contrast to that of the north-west, as the land<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
lies low, but is in general very fertile. As long ago
as 1852 we marched through the district of
Tungku on Darvel Bay, and could not but
admire the splendid crops which covered the earth,
and the vigour of the growth of the palms and
fruit trees.</p>

<p>The principal settlements of the North Borneo
Company are Labuan, Padas, Kalias and Sandakan.
To Labuan I have already referred. As a centre of
native trade it is likely to become important, and
Victoria Harbour is often crowded with steamers
anxious to secure coal. Its unhealthy stage appears
to have passed away; in fact, the whole of North
Borneo may be looked upon as fairly healthy, for
although on the north-east coast there are many
districts where fever is prevalent (an incident
common to every tropical country when the jungle
is first cut down), yet this malaria disperses in
time.</p>

<p>Next to Labuan lie the districts of Padas and
Kalias, well filled with an agricultural population,
quiet and fairly industrious. Their principal industry is
the cultivation of the sago palm and pepper. Padas
had been chosen as the starting point of the telegraph
line, which has been carried across the country to
Sandakan Bay, a distance of three hundred miles. It
does not appear to work very successfully, as it is
liable to constant interruption from the wires being
broken by falling trees. My experience of Bornean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
forests is that trees seldom fall even during the
fiercest storms if their supports are left untouched.
The finest forest trees, except the Tapang, have
most of their roots running along the surface of the
ground, and have a very poor hold, but they are
supported in their positions by innumerable creepers,
which vary in size from those resembling a ship’s
cable in diameter to the most delicate rattan. Cut
these braces and the tree is liable to fall. This is
so well known to the natives that, when clearing old
forests, they only cut the principal trees partly
through, except a line of the outermost ones, which
are hacked until they give signs of falling. The whole
line then comes down, dragging to the earth all the
trees partially cut through, as if they were bound
together by cords, instead of by Nature’s cables. It is
probably the cutting of the telegraphic line through
the forest which has weakened the natural supports,
and so the trees fall. If any other telegraph line be run
it would be worth while trying to make the forest trees
serve instead of poles, as these appear to have rotted
within the first year.</p>

<p>From the occasional notices in the <cite>Herald</cite>, the
North Borneo official paper, it would appear that the
line was cut most of the way through primeval forest,
thus opening out millions of acres of virgin land for
agriculturists to develop. When the existence of
this line is thoroughly understood, and its working
can be ensured, it will no doubt induce those ships<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
which trade between Australia and China to call in at
Sandakan. Had the line been reliable, no doubt the
Spaniards of the Philippines would have used it, in order
to telegraph to their Government, instead of going
all the way round to Labuan.</p>

<p>But the great experiment in Borneo is the railway.
It starts from what may be termed the Padas district,
at a point on the coast called Bukau, and the first
section is to the Penotal Gorge, about fifty miles in
the interior on the way to the east coast. Its course,
as traced on the map, will take it well south of east,
and it will have its terminus in Santa Lucia Bay. I
have seen no reason given why it should not be taken
to Sandakan, the headquarters of the Company, and
a first-class harbour. It appears a mistake to lessen
the importance of the capital, unless there are strong
commercial reasons, depending on the tobacco
plantations, for diverting its course through an unknown
country, close to the Dutch frontiers.</p>

<p>If this railway succeed it will open a new era in
Bornean development; and it should succeed, as, with
liberal land laws, foreigners and natives will settle
along the line and form plantations. But who are
the inhabitants beyond the Penotal Gorge? They are
mentioned once or twice in the course of the reports
as Muruts or Dusuns, who will no doubt work jungle
produce as soon as they find a profitable market; in
fact, they are doing so now to a small extent. If the
promises made to the Company be kept, and sawmills<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
be erected near the western terminus, then the timber
trade will give profitable employment to the railway.
Neither timber nor jungle produce, however, will make
a railway pay, and therefore the Company must be
prepared to support cultivators and planters all along
the line, and the money will be well and profitably
employed. They have themselves started an experimental
plantation at Sapong, where tobacco and other
products are cultivated with very fair success, and this
will encourage others. I shall watch the progress of
this railway with the greatest interest, and though
there will be many complaints at its slow progress,
yet if capital can be found to finish it, it must prove of
great benefit to the Company. It is satisfactory to
learn, from the latest reports, that the natives are
flocking to its neighbourhood, and that they have
already cleared the land for a width of three miles on
either side of the line.</p>

<p>Gaya Bay has so lately come under the direct
control of the Company that nothing has been done
yet for its development, but only some of its smaller
harbours can be expected to be touched at first.
Nearly all the districts in its neighbourhood are, however,
fairly populated, and there is considerable cultivation
on the rivers Patatan, Ananam and Kabatuan.</p>

<p>Kudat, on Marudu Bay, appears at one time to have
been chosen for the Governor’s headquarters, but it
showed no promise of rapid development, and they
have now been transferred to Sandakan. There is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
however, a good deal of cultivation going on, and among
the immigrants are several hundred Chinese Christians
called Hakkas, who appear to have fled from the
persecution of their heathen brethren. These are
likely to be a permanent population and should be
encouraged, as they are sure to support the
Government.</p>

<p>The most important settlement on the mainland of
Borneo, within the Company’s grants, is Sandakan.
It is a fine bay, fairly healthy, with excellent sites for a
town, and is connected by a water passage with the
important river of Kina Batañgan, from which a short
road leads to the gold workings of Sigama. Its inhabitants
already muster, I understand, about three
thousand, and it has the principal Government offices,
a church, a club, an hotel and some rideable roads.
It only wants coal to render it an important port of
call, and this is said to have been found not far from
the town, and is about to be worked.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the districts under the sway of
the Company are of many different races. The bulk
of the population are Dusuns or Idaán, very much like
the better class of the Land Dyaks of Sarawak. They
are easily governed, and among them head hunting is
a tradition rather than a practice, as only in one village
that Sir Hugh Low and I visited did we find a head
house, or any skulls hung up to the rafters, as is
commonly the case in the communities south of
the Baram. We stayed in their villages on several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
occasions, and formed a very favourable opinion of
the people.</p>

<p>The above remarks are based upon our observations
made in 1858, but, if Mr John Whitehead is not
mistaken, these races must have greatly deteriorated,
as he writes a good deal about the practice of head
hunting among them in 1888. When we were there
we heard like reports and met many parties of armed
Dusuns, who were said to be on the war-path, but as at
the same time we also met numerous parties of Dusun
men, women and children carrying tobacco to the coast
villages through what was said to be an enemy’s
country, we did not pay much attention to such
statements. We saw also small parties of women and
children working in the fields miles away from their
villages, which could not occur if there were any real
danger from hostile tribes. Either Mr Whitehead
was deceived by similar stories to those which were
constantly dinned into our ears, or the Dusuns have
sadly deteriorated. These stories of enemies were
fabricated chiefly with the object of preventing our
visiting neighbouring villages.</p>

<p>I am afraid we should find great changes if we
returned to Kina Balu, as Mr Whitehead mentions
that the Company have found it necessary to send
punitive expeditions against these Dusuns. I trust,
however, that this is a mistake.</p>

<p>The next in importance to the Dusuns from their
numbers are the Bajaus, who are still often called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
Sea Gipsies from their wandering habits, but many
thousands of them have abandoned their old custom
of living in boats and have settled on the lake-like
Mengkabong river and in many other places along
the north-west coast, until you reach Tampasuk,
where, a few miles inland, they are numerous. The
Bajaus are also to be found on the north and east
coasts, and are there deemed a very useful class, as
fishermen and collectors of sea produce for export to
the China market.</p>

<p>The Lanuns, of marauding celebrity, lived formerly
on the Lower Tampasuk and Padasan rivers, but since
their pirate settlements were routed out by Sir
Thomas Cochrane in 1846, they have gradually
abandoned the coast, and retired to their own country,
the great island of Mindanau. Probably a few who
have intermarried with the Bajaus may still be left.
They were a gallant, courteous people, but too lawless
for our times.</p>

<p>On the north-east coast there is a very mixed
population of people from the Sulu Islands—some
Malays, many Bajaus, and since the advent of the
Company, several Chinese and a few Europeans and
Madrasees.</p>

<p>In Padas and Kalias and on the rivers to the south
of Patatan, there are many Malays from Brunei;
Kadayans, who are probably aborigines converted to
Islam; many descendants of the ancient Chinese colony,
who can still speak their old language, but dress and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
live like other natives of the island. From these curious
mixtures of races are derived the industrious agriculturists
of those districts.</p>

<p>The native Borneans of whatever race have shown
no power to augment the population. The deaths
appear almost to equal the births, but that may
arise from the great neglect of the children, and the
inability of the natives to combat epidemics—smallpox
and cholera sometimes sweeping them off by
thousands. These causes of depopulation may lessen
under the influence of civilisation, but not to a very
great extent.</p>

<p>The Company will have therefore to depend on the
Chinese, and perhaps on the Japanese, for the future
population, as their industry is undoubted, and the
teeming millions of the parent countries can supply
endless recruits. But it would be dangerous to rely
upon these hard-working but turbulent people alone,
and therefore a mixture of Javanese, Boyans and Tamils
would be very desirable.</p>

<p>The Company have very rightly based their
prosperity on agriculture, and have done much to
encourage subsidiary associations in their efforts to
cultivate tobacco, and in some respects with very
great success, as the produce has been of first-rate
quality and fetches very high prices. In fact, the soil
appears particularly adapted to this valuable plant,
but, as always occurs when any new business is started,
insufficient capital, and managers without any idea of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
economical working, nearly wrecked this promising
industry. It now appears to have passed this trying
stage and established itself on a firm basis, and its
prospects are excellent.</p>

<p>The soil of the east coast, and many districts of
the west, appears suited to every tropical cultivation.
Coffee, both Liberian and Asiatic, grows with astonishing
vigour, even yielding fruit in the third year. In
other countries the best coffee is grown on hills at
least three thousand feet above the sea level, and
planters in Borneo may find it worth their while to
attend to this. It is in favour of planters that all the
products they have essayed have flourished for generations
before the advent of the Company. Coffee is
found in the hills round the capital. I sent home
excellent specimens of cotton grown on the north-west
coast as long ago as in the Fifties, and Saba
tobacco was famous and much preferred to the
Javanese by all the natives of Brunei. We noticed at
Kiau, on Kina Balu, how carefully the Dusuns
cultivated their tobacco, keeping the fields perfectly
clean. Pepper was grown by the Chinese throughout
the last century, so that none of these products are
experiments. They have simply to be grown by experienced
managers, instead of by the careless native
methods.</p>

<p>As yet the search for minerals has not been
successful. Gold has been found in many districts,
but has not hitherto been worked so as to prove a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
mercantile success. As, however, alluvial gold has been
collected in several streams, the quartz reefs will yet
be found, as in Sarawak, where, after more than fifty
years of expectation, machinery has been erected to
crush the stone. A small company has been formed
in London to work the gold found in the sand and
gravel banks in the Sigama river, which will be raised
from its bed by a dredging machine. The latest
accounts are that the dredger is already above the
rapids, and had commenced working. There is
nothing in the world like gold to attract population.</p>

<p>The geological formation of the great mountain
of Kina Balu, and its surrounding ranges, would appear
to offer a grand field for geologists, but it is a difficult
country to explore, except where the sandstones check
vegetation, but these last-named strata are never prolific
in minerals.</p>

<p>Since the North Borneo Company has had a business
man at their head, and there is a better knowledge of
Borneo among the directors, it appears to be going
the right way to work to develop the country. It
has made some necessary roads; the electric telegraph,
though not at present very important in itself, has
opened up the interior and shown what may be
expected from pushing on the railway through this as
yet undeveloped country.</p>

<p>The territory of the State of North Borneo is
under the rule of a governor, Mr Beaufort, chosen by
the Court of Directors, and under him are many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
Residents and sub-officers who administer the affairs
in the various districts. As the <cite>Herald</cite> appears to
publish only <em>résumés</em> of the reports from the different
stations, it is difficult to form any idea of the capacity
of the officials or the manner in which they perform
their work, but, on the whole, I should say it was
satisfactory. However, there is nothing more difficult
than to find men to manage natives so as to gain their
confidence. As a rule the higher the class from
which they are chosen, the greater chance there is
of their success.</p>

<p>The State of North Borneo has an armed police,
which only numbers four hundred, for their very
extensive territory, and it proves how amenable the
natives must be to authority that they can keep comparative
order. The few outbreaks which have occurred
have been easily suppressed, though as yet it is uncertain
what will be the future conduct of the last rebel, Mat
Sali, and his gang. If terms have been made with him
which will in the future keep him quiet, so much the
better for all. A portion of the North Borneo armed
police consists of Sikhs. It is difficult to exaggerate the
admirable conduct of these men during the difficult
operations against Mat Sali. In the attacks on his
fort their behaviour was simply splendid, and their
English officers, both civil and military, were indeed
well worthy to lead such men. It is to be regretted
that their brave commandant, Jones, was killed. It is
easy to criticise the desperate onslaught, and say it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
foolhardy, but it is by such gallant contempt of odds
that the Empire has been won, and that we can record
with pride ‘the Deeds which made the Empire.’ And
all this goes on in an almost forgotten part of the
world, as a mere matter of duty, without any idea
on the part of these brave fellows that their
countrymen will ever hear of their noble conduct.
Wherever the Sikhs and their English officers may
be, we may feel assured of good work being done,
as, for instance, in East Africa, with the late
Lieutenant Alston and his dashing followers.</p>

<p>The revenue is raised in British North Borneo
generally on the lines adopted in other Eastern
possessions. The principal source of income is derived
from ‘farms.’ The most important are those of
opium and spirits. They are the easiest and best
methods of raising revenue, as they only touch the
weaknesses or the vices of the Chinese, and are generally
highly productive; and, where the authorities are
not amenable to the influence of ignorant but well-meaning
fanatics, the gambling farm is not only
productive but has a good moral effect, as experience
has proved that the evil is lessened by being concentrated
at spots under the surveillance of the police.
The farms of pork and fish, and in a lesser degree,
perhaps, the pawnbroking, are liable to great objections.
The pork farm might be suppressed and public
slaughter-houses established, as is done now in Sarawak;
and pawnbroker’s licenses might be substituted for that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
farm, which, in practice, proves so onerous to the poor.
The fish farm should be suppressed and an open
market substituted. As there is no clear financial
statement published, I am aware that I may be criticising
in the dark.</p>

<p>Duties on imports are often necessary, and export
duties on timber and jungle produce are very defensible,
as someone aptly remarked that the collectors only
reap the harvest without having been put to the
trouble or expense of sowing or planting, and someone
must pay for the protection they all enjoy. As a
rule, however, duties on agricultural products should
be avoided. The tax on nibongs and attaps is something
quite original, can produce but a trifle, and
must be excessively annoying to the natives, as these
are the building materials of their houses.</p>

<p>I will now give the receipts and expenditure in
North Borneo for the five years 1893-7, as the receipts
are now normal, and not affected by the speculative
rush of planters and others, who disbursed money
without a thought of the morrow:—</p>

<p>As far as it goes this is a satisfactory increase in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
revenue, but is a mere bagatelle if we consider the
vast territory from which it is produced. But no
striking increase can take place until the Chinese feel
thoroughly at home there. That North Borneo was
once very popular with them is attested by all the
accounts we gather from travellers and from native
tradition. The very names show how they influenced
the country. We have Kina Benua, the Chinese land;
Kina Balu, the Chinese widow, the name of the
great mountain; Kina Batañgan, the Chinese river
(in the written annals of the Court of Brunei, it is
mentioned that a Chinese kingdom was established
on that river); then we have Kina Taki and Kina
Bañgun, the names of small streams in the north.
This shows how numerous the Chinese must have been
in this territory. The causes of their disappearance
are obscure, but may be readily imagined. Bad government
in Brunei, the increase of piracy, the cutting off
of the junks, the risings against oppression by this
unwarlike race led to massacres; in fact, these causes
are clear from the accounts of the natives. But where
the Chinese have once been, they will come again.</p>

<p>It must be uphill work trying to extract taxes
from natives, who, though they are accustomed to
be robbed and plundered by their own rulers, are very
unwilling to pay even the smallest regular impost.
The Sarawak Malays do so readily with their capitation
tax, as that payment frees them from the
liability of being called out for military service, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
the more civilised and industrious they become, the
more they appreciate this freedom from liability.
The capitation tax is a just one, though often it
requires great caution in its collection to avoid
discontent. As a rule it should not be collected in
those districts in which the Company have no permanent
officers located. Flying visits often do more
harm than good. It is difficult to see how any
addition can be made to the taxation. The State of
Borneo must trust to the gradual development of the
country and to the increase of its population, but all
trammels on the free circulation of traders should be
removed.</p>

<p>It is evident from the trade returns of North
Borneo that the country is progressing. Take the
statistics for the same five years:—</p>

<p>The dollar is now only worth two shillings. I do
not know if these returns include those of our
Colony of Labuan. I believe not, as no mention is
made of the export of coal in the detailed lists.</p>

<p>Tobacco is the most important article of export.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
There are several companies busily engaged in developing
this industry, as the Bornean leaf has now
taken a high position in the markets, and its quality
is excellent. It not only furnishes the leaves used
as wrappers, but as a smoking tobacco it has met
with much favour. The principal plantations are in
the north-eastern coast, near the river Kina
Batañgan and Darvel Bay. The Government are
also trying an experiment on the Sapong line, which
will be followed by the railway. The tobacco which
was so sought after by the natives in old days was,
however, a product principally of the north-west
coast. It would probably be advantageous to find out
the exact spots where the Saba plants were grown.
There is very little likelihood of there being a glut
of tobacco on the market, as many of the old sources
of supply are drying up, as in Cuba, and, to a lesser
extent, in Manila, and the recent judicious reduction
of duty in England will increase its consumption.
I have no sympathy with those who would instead
have lowered or abolished the duty on tea, as if tea
drinkers should not contribute to the support of our
navy, which secures the arrival of their favourite leaf.</p>

<p>The production of coffee, cotton, gambier and
pepper are as yet on a very small scale, as most of the
plantations are in their infancy. Pepper used to
be grown to a considerable extent in the districts
opposite, and a little north of Labuan, but here, as
elsewhere, no doubt, the exceedingly low prices may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
have induced the natives to neglect the cultivation
of this vine. Sarawak now produces about 15,000
tons of gambier, worth $700,000. This should encourage
planters in North Borneo.</p>

<p>Cutch, manufactured from the bark of the mangrove
tree, has became a very important export, and
the development of this industry can only be limited
by the demand. Gutta and rubber are of some
importance, and rattans are taking an important
place in the list of exports, and so are sago flour
and timber. Although as a rule export duties on
cultivated products are to be avoided, there are many
good reasons why the Government should put a duty
on tobacco, which, however, is so very light, only
one per cent., as scarcely to affect its price, whilst
the sum so raised is of importance to the Treasury.
The police and other expenses connected with the
protection of this industry are considerable.</p>

<p>In reading over the reports in the <cite>North Borneo
Herald</cite>, I have noticed the tendency of the officers
in charge of districts to interfere with the movements
of traders. One will only allow certain men to go
into the interior to collect jungle products, but they
must not take with them merchandise to barter
with the natives; another objects to traders going
into the interior to buy produce there, as it prevents
the aborigines coming down to have ‘a glimpse of
civilisation’; a third charges for permits, which
induces people to get into the Company’s interior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
districts from the Brunei territory, and to return
that way, thus depriving the Government of its
export duties (to this I notice Mr Maxwell objected);
a fourth is afraid that the Chinaman will cheat the
innocent Dusun, but after a very short time the
latter becomes a very good match for the trader. I
remember certain natives bringing hundreds of pikuls
of worthless gutta, carefully coated over with the
genuine article, to the bazaar in Sarawak. The Chinaman
tested it, and finding no stones concealed inside
the lumps, bought it at rather a high price, but was
surprised to find on its being sent to Singapore that
it was unsaleable. I do not think, therefore, that the
officers of the State of North Borneo need trouble
themselves about the trading incapacity of the Dusuns.
But the scales and weights of the Chinese should be
periodically tested, as this is their favourite method of
cheating the unwary.</p>

<p>I have always objected to these restrictions on
trade, and to the free movements of traders, as they
existed in Sarawak. They owed their origin there, as
in North Borneo, to the jealousy of the native chiefs,
who do their utmost to monopolise the trade themselves,
and therefore counsel the English officers not
to allow Chinamen to penetrate into the interior.
I would give perfect liberty to everyone, and this
would not only increase the number of traders, but
add considerably to the exports.</p>

<p>I have considered with great attention the negotiations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
which took place between the directors of the
British North Borneo Company and the present
Rajah of Sarawak, Sir Charles Brooke, and I have come
to the conclusion that the shareholders were perfectly
right not to part with their territory or resign its
management. The Rajah would have found this
great increase of dominion very burdensome, and I
should be inclined to doubt whether Sarawak possesses
either the capital or the staff to enable her thus to
increase her responsibilities. Sarawak, as I have observed,
has generally failed to attract English capital,
and although the Rajah has governed his own territories
with eminent success, it does not follow that he
would have succeeded in so developing North Borneo
as ever to have been able to pay the shareholders a
dividend. They have already waited seventeen years,
with an occasional trifling return, and probably they may
have to wait some time yet, as the country has been but
very partially opened out, but that there is a great
future before North Borneo, I have full confidence.</p>

<p>When the State of North Borneo has advanced
sufficiently, it might follow the example of the old
East India Company—convert the capital of the
association into stock at high interest to compensate
for past losses, and then, under a Court of Directors,
devote the whole of the revenue of the State to the
advancement of the interests and welfare of the
country. This solution would no doubt be satisfactory
to everyone connected with the enterprise.</p>

<p class="center no-indent"><cite>Mr Brooke’s Expedition to Borneo.</cite><a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>


<p class="no-indent">Borneo (in the language of the natives Bruni),
Celebes, Sulu, the Moluccas, and the islands of the
Straits of Sunda and Banca, compose what is
commonly called the Malayan group, and the Malays
located on the sea shores of these and other islands
may with certainty be classed as belonging to one
nation.</p>

<p>It is well known, however, that the interior of these
countries is inhabited by various tribes, differing from
the Malays and each other, and presenting numerous
gradations of imperfect civilisation.</p>

<p>The Dyaks of Borneo, the Arafuras of New
Guinea, and others, besides the black race scattered
over the islands (objects here, as elsewhere, of traffic),
present an interesting field of inquiry; and it is
surprising, whilst our acquaintance with every other
portion of the globe, from the passage of the Pole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
to the navigation of the Euphrates, has greatly extended,
we know scarcely anything of these varieties
of the human race beyond the bare fact of their
existence, and remain extremely ignorant of the
geographical features of the countries they inhabit.</p>

<p>Countries which present an extended field for
Christianity and commerce—which none surpass in
fertility—rich beyond the Americas in mineral productions,
and unrivalled in natural beauty, yet continue
unexplored, and spite of the advantages which
would probably result, have failed to attract the
attention they so well deserve. The difficulty of
the undertaking will scarcely account for its non-performance;
if we consider the voluntary sacrifices
made on the shrine of African research, or
the energy displayed and the sufferings encountered
by the explorers of the Polar regions, yet the
necessity of prosecuting the voyage in an armed
vessel, the wildness of the interior tribes, the lawless
ferocity of the Malays, and the dangers to be
apprehended from the jealousy of the Dutch, would
prevent most individuals from fixing on this field
for their exertions, and points it out as one which
can only be fully accomplished by Government, or
some influential body.</p>

<p>It is not my object to enter into any detail of the
past history of the Malayan nations, but I may refer
to the undoubted fact that they have been in a state
of deterioration since we first became acquainted with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
them; and the records of our early voyagers, together
with the remains of antiquity still visible in Java and
Sumatra, prove that once flourishing nations have
now ceased to exist, and countries once teeming with
human life are now tenantless and deserted. The
causes of such lamentable changes need only be
alluded to, but it is fit to remark that whilst the
clamour about education is loud, and extravagant
dreams are entertained of the progressive advancement
of the human race, a large tract of the globe
has been gradually relapsing, and allowed to relapse,
into barbarism.</p>

<p>Whether the early decay of the Malay states and
their consequent demoralization arose from the introduction
of Mohammedanism, or resulted from the
intrigues of European ambition, it were useless to
discuss; but we are very certain that the policy of
the Dutch has, at the present day, reduced this
‘Eden of the Eastern wave’ to a state of anarchy
and confusion, as repugnant to humanity as it is
to commercial prosperity.</p>

<p>Enough is known of the harshness of this policy,
and there is no need of here contrasting it with the
energetic, successful, though ill-supported sway of Sir
Stamford Raffles—but it is the indirect influence
which it exerts that has proved so baneful to the
Archipelago, under the assumed jurisdiction of this
European power. Her unceasing interference in the
concerns of the Malay Governments, and the watchful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
fomenting of their internal dissensions, have gradually
and effectually destroyed all rightful authority,
and given rise to a number of petty states, which
thrive on piracy and fatten on the slave trade. The
consequent disorganisation of society arising from
these causes has placed a bar to commercial enterprise
and personal adventure, and has probably acted
on the interior tribes much in the same way as
this fatal policy has affected the Malays. As far
as can be ascertained, the financial and commercial
concerns of the Dutch have not been prosperous; it
is easy to conceive such to be the case, as it will be
conceded that oppression and prosperity cannot coexist.
In short, with the smallest possible amount of
advantage, the Dutch Government has all along endeavoured
to perpetuate an exclusive system, aiming
more at injury to others than any advantage to themselves,
or to the nations under their sway; for where
an enlightened administration might have produced
the most beneficial results, we are forced to deplore
not only the mischief done, and the mass of good
neglected, but the misery and suffering inflicted on
unhappy races, capable, as has been proved, of
favourable development under other circumstances.</p>

<p>The policy of the British in the Indian Archipelago
has been marked by vacillation and weakness.
The East India Company, with a strong desire to
rival the Dutch, aimed at doing so by indirect and
underhand means, and shrunk from the liberality of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
views and bold line of conduct which was perhaps
inconsistent with their position and tenure of authority.
It was in vain that Sir Stamford Raffles urged on
them a line of conduct which, had it been pursued,
must eventually have ensured the ascendency of the
British over the space from Borneo to New Holland,
and have linked her colonies in the East by a chain
of posts from the northern part of India to the
southern extremity of Van Diemen’s Land. The
timidity of the Company and the ignorance or indifference
of the then existing Governments not
only neglected to carry this bold project into execution,
but sacrificed the advantages already acquired,
and, without stipulation or reserve, yielded the improving
Javanese to the tender mercies of their
former masters. The consequences are well known;
all the evils of Dutch rule have been re-established,
and the British watchfully excluded, directly or indirectly,
from the commerce of the islands.</p>

<p>It is true that the settlement of Singapore has
attracted a large portion of the native trade to its
free port, and has become, from its happy situation,
in some measure an emporium for Straits’ produce;
but, with this single commercial exception, our loss of
footing and political influence in the Archipelago is
complete, and our intercourse with the natives has
gradually become more restricted. We may sum up
these remarks by taking a brief survey of the present
position of the Archipelago. The Dutch are masters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
of a large tract of New Guinea at one extreme, and,
at the other, have possessed themselves of the coast
of Borneo, extending from the western boundary of
Borneo proper to the southern limit of Matan. A
glance at the chart will show that they have stations
of more or less importance connecting these points,
and that Java, and their settlement on Sumatra, give
them exclusive command of the Straits of Sunda. It
may likewise be here observed that their territorial
extension is only limited by their desires, for as there
is no check from European nations, a title to possession
is too readily acquired from distracted and contending
native Governments.</p>

<p>But the position of the Dutch nation in the ‘Far
East,’ though apparently so imposing, is, in reality, far
from strong, and their power would easily sink before
the vigorous opposition of any European country.</p>

<p>Java, exhausted and rebellious, submits, but remembers
the period of British possession. The wild
Battas, of Sumatra, successfully repel the efforts of
the Dutch to reduce them. The Chinese of the
southern part of Borneo are eager to cast off the
yoke of masters who debar them every advantage,
and would fain, were it in their power, exact a
heavy tribute. Their possessions in New Guinea are
nominal rather than real, and their older settlement
of the Moluccas, fallen in value, can scarcely be
supposed to compensate for the sacrifice of men
and money caused by their narrow-minded views<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
and ill-directed efforts. The Dutch are strong
enough to defy any native power directed against
them, but their doubtful title and oppressive tenure
would, as I have before said, render the downfall of
their rule in the Archipelago certain and easy
before the establishment of a liberal Government
and conciliating policy.</p>

<p>Of the Malays, it is sufficient here to remark that
they have ceased to be powerful, and that their distracted
and disorganised state renders it dangerous
for friends or strangers to trust themselves in their
hands; but their hatred of the Dutch is unbounded,
and there is no reason to think that any insuperable
obstacle would be met with in the formation
of a strong legitimate Government amongst them.</p>

<p>Our recent knowledge of the position of the native
states is so circumscribed, however, that it is difficult
to say much on this subject.</p>

<p>The Bugis, the traders of the islands, and their
hardiest and most enterprising race, are checked and
hampered by Dutch restrictions, and this remark,
applying most forcibly to them, is true of the whole
trading interests, and renders all alike inveterately
hostile to the Dutch.</p>

<p>It may be fairly concluded from the foregoing
remarks that the injury done to British interests by
the cession of Java and the consequent loss of power
has been greatly counterbalanced by the misrule of the
Dutch since their undisputed re-establishment. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
field is again open, therefore, to any nation desirous of
rivalling Holland, and little doubt can be entertained
of the success of such an effort, if carried on by a
course of policy and conduct the reverse in every
respect of that pursued by the present monopolists.
The fact must be always borne in mind that the
Dutch are masters of the Archipelago <em>only</em> because
no other nation is willing to compete with them, and
although any attempt by another power might, and
would, doubtless, be watched with the greatest anxiety
and distrust, and every opposition, direct and indirect,
be levelled against it, yet it could not be considered any
infringement of acknowledged right or actual possession.</p>

<p>A liberal system, indeed, recommended by mutual
advantage, would assuredly triumph over any local
opposition, if not obstructed by European interests;
nor is there any great reason to apprehend such a
probability, unless, going from one extreme to another,
we should attempt hostility to regain what was
foolishly thrown away.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, sooner or later, the time <em>must</em> arrive
when we shall again be in possession of these islands,
and we may accordingly look forward and prepare
for the event in various ways.</p>

<p>The subject may be divided under two heads, viz.,
Territorial Possession, and Commercial Prosperity;
and these appear so intimately blended, that the
second is greatly dependent on the first, for it must
be remembered that Sir Stamford Raffles, the highest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
authority on this point, has pronounced that no
purely commercial settlement can succeed in the
Archipelago, and has attributed the numerous failures
which have occurred to a lack of knowledge of the
country, and the non-possession of territory.</p>

<p>Many arguments might be urged, and many
reasons given, to show the entire justice of this
opinion, but it will be sufficient to state that
where a native population exists, and is rightly
governed, an influence is insensibly acquired and
strengthened, not only over those immediately protected,
but also over the neighbouring tribes, and
that on the occasion of any disturbance or collision
with other powers, the means of resistance or the
punishment of aggression are at hand. A commercial
post, on the contrary, though advantageously
situated, is liable to the fluctuations and distractions
of its neighbours, its means of attack or defence
are necessarily limited, and whilst it fails to command
respect, the natives are rather injured than
benefited by its existence.</p>

<p>The chief consideration, however, seems to be that
territorial power is constantly opening new sources of
traffic, and extending those already established, by
disembarrassing trade of the intermediate clogs which
tend to limit exports, from the small amount of benefit
to the original dealer—and to lessen the demand—from
the increased price attendant on passing through
various hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>The insular situation of Singapore may be adduced
as a proof of this, for all articles of Straits produce,
before coming into the possession of the British
merchant, afford profits to several classes of natives,
in a very unequal degree; and little hope can be
entertained of the favourable progress of a trade
wherein the original producer or proprietor participates
to so trifling an extent in its advantages. It
may, indeed, be considered a monopoly by the natives
inhabiting the coasts, as severe on the interior tribes
as the Dutch restrictions on themselves.</p>

<p>For these and many other causes which readily
occur, it would seem that territorial possession is the
best, if not the only means, by which to acquire a
direct and powerful influence in the Archipelago, but
any government instituted for the purpose must be
directed to the advancement of the native interests
and the development of native resources rather
than by a flood of European colonization, to aim
at possession only, without reference to the indefeasible
rights of the Aborigines.</p>

<p>On the second head, viz., the Commercial Prosperity,
nothing need be added save that, being
dependent on the right working of the first principle,
it must unavoidably, in its progress, present a striking
contrast to the commercial monopolies of the
Dutch, and be the means of bringing the English
merchant in contact with the original native dealer.</p>

<p>The advantages, political and commercial, accruing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
from a well-managed territory need only be alluded
to, as everyone in the slightest degree acquainted with
the country is well aware of its vast capability.</p>

<p>In a political view, the contiguity of the islands to
our possessions in New Holland and India, and the
command over China, are sufficiently apparent; and
commercially, it would only be necessary to quote
their productions to prove their value. The difficulty
of once more placing our interests on a footing
worthy a great nation is no doubt considerable, but
apt to be greatly overrated; as the unpopularity of
the Dutch, and the weakness of the native states,
would ensure success to an establishment aiming at
sufficient results by slow but steady means. The
question, indeed, is not one embracing the acquisition
of territory, but its <em>occupation</em>: viz., whether England
shall claim and improve lands she holds by as good a
title as any the Dutch can show, and whether, doing
so, she shall use the full ascendency of her national
position to extend her commerce, and distribute her
manufactures among a people who have always, when
permitted, shown their craving for mercantile adventure?</p>

<p>A strong government established in Malludu<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Bay,
a British territory capable of extension, and possessing
internal resources, having sufficient authority to cultivate
a good understanding with the native governments,
and spread inferior posts over the Archipelago,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
as opportunities offered, would effect this object, and,
without infringing upon the claims of any foreign
state, ensure a commercial footing on a scale never
yet developed in this portion of the world. Malludu
Bay, situated at the northern extremity of Borneo,
has been mentioned as best adapted for the purpose in
view on several accounts.</p>

<p>1st. It is a British possession.</p>

<p>2nd. There is no great Malay or Bugis settlement
in its vicinity.</p>

<p>3rd. It is the place where, in all probability, a
direct intercourse may be held with the Dyaks of
the interior.</p>

<p>4th. The position relative to China is advantageous.</p>

<p>5th. It forms the western limit of the Archipelago,
and our new settlement at Port Essington bounds
it to the eastward. The climate and the soil are
well spoken of: a river flows into the bay, and is
reported to communicate with the lake of Keeny
Balloo<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and the mountains in the interior—one of
very considerable elevation. Above all, however,
the natives are reported to be docile and easily
taught; the servants of the Company attached to
their settlement of Balambangan were decided in
opinion that this bay was far preferable in every
respect to the station chosen and subsequently
abandoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>Supposing these advantages to be as above stated,
yet it would scarcely authorise any active steps being
taken without a more accurate knowledge than we
at present possess of the particular locality and of
the States in its vicinity; it is to this point that I
would direct attention, remarking, however, that
although Malludu Bay should on inquiry be found
to be unfit for the purposes of colonisation, yet the
general view of our policy remains unaffected, as
it would be only necessary to obtain a suitable
place.</p>

<p>With a settlement at each extremity of the Archipelago,
we could readily protect the trade of the
natives, and obtain minor posts, and free-trade ports,
whence the best principles of commerce and good
government might be disseminated, and our interests
best promoted, by the general prosperity of
the countries under our sway, or in our own
vicinity. It is scarcely necessary to say more on
this subject, but before closing these remarks, I
cannot help adverting to the colony at Port
Essington.</p>

<p>The former settlement, which existed in the immediate
neighbourhood of Port Essington, was after
a trial (of a few years) abandoned as useless, and
the same difficulties which checked the progress of
the first will probably impede the present colony.</p>

<p>It was a striking feature of this settlement, that the
natives, though frequenting the coasts to the northward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
of New Holland,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> seldom if ever visited or offered
to trade with the settlement. This has, I know,
been attributed to the natives being ignorant of the
existence of the place, but this reason appears to me
improbable in the highest degree, and we may with
more justice surmise the cause to be our utter disinclination
and local inability to protect traders from
the consequences attendant on a breach of Dutch
regulations. This conjecture gathers confirmation
from the facts that the inhabitants of the Eastern
portion of the Archipelago are not addicted to
maritime adventure, being supplied by the traders of
the Western Islands with such articles of European
or Chinese manufacture as are suited to their tastes.
The Bugis vessels that frequent the north coast of
New Holland chiefly carry on the trade with the
Arafura group, and it is evident that going and
returning from this voyage they are at the mercy of
the Dutch cruisers. Is it probable, then, that the
Dutch would allow an intercourse with a British
settlement which it was in their power to prevent?
And whilst the Bugis are the carriers, is it not in the
power of the Dutch to restrict and harass, if not
totally to prevent, their communication with us?
The natives of the Archipelago cannot look to the
British for protection, but they can and do look for
Dutch vengeance, and dread it.</p>

<p>These considerations are not urged against advantages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
to be derived from the possession of Port Essington,
but rather as a warning against the over-sanguine
expectations of its having a trade of any considerable
extent, whilst our relations with the Archipelago continue
on their present eclipsed footing. The good to
result from this colony must be looked for on the
continent of New Holland, where it will probably
extend and make the same progressive strides to importance
as the sister colonies in the same country:
but with reference to the Archipelago, its government
will want authority to control the evil influence
sufficiently to ameliorate the present system.</p>

<p>Not far distant to the westward of Port Essington
is the large and fertile island of Timor, a portion of
which there is no doubt the Government of Portugal
would cede willingly for the smallest equivalent, as
it has been long virtually abandoned, and is utterly
useless to the mother country. The size and situation
would render the possession of the Portuguese
frontier of this island a desirable acquisition, and the
favourable opportunity may not, if allowed to pass
over, again recur.</p>

<p>The same, indeed, may be said of Leuconia, which,
offering no real benefit to Spain, would, in the hands
of the English, be a lever to rule both China and the
Archipelago. Rich, fertile, and blessed with a fine
climate, within a few days’ sail of Canton, and commanding
the China sea, it would be an unrivalled
jewel in the colonial tiara of England. When our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
relations with China come to be settled, and settled
they must shortly be, the importance of Manila can
scarcely be overrated.</p>

<p>Spain, distracted and torn by internal factions, and
pledged to England by treaty and obligation, would
readily place Leuconia in our hands as a guarantee for
the sums due, and would probably cede the possession
in lieu of the claims we have on her exchequer.</p>

<p>For such an acquisition, the present is the time,
the tide in our affairs which, taken at the flood, would
lead on to fortune; and as I have before stated, that in
a political point of view it is only on an extended scale
that any real advantage, national or local, is to be
gained, I must re-urge my conviction that it is better
to leave the Archipelago in its present state until the
next general war, when it will again pass into our
hands, than, by contenting ourselves with paltry and
insignificant stations, convey false impressions of our
national importance, not easily removed from the
minds of the natives.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Whatever difference of opinion may exist, or whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
degree of credit may be due to the views here
recommended, there can be no doubt of our future
ascendency in the Archipelago, whether attempted
at the present time, or delayed until the fortunes of
war offer a fitting occasion. In either case a previous
acquaintance will greatly facilitate the result, and must
in all probability tend to a more just appreciation of
these highly interesting countries; for when public
attention is once aroused, and a stimulus given to
inquiry, it cannot fail in fully developing the resources,
and exhausting the knowledge of the mine,
which has heretofore been left to the weak and
casual efforts of individual exertion. It has been
remarked by Mr Farquhar that the indifference of
the British Government must have originated solely
from the want of information, or its incorrectness,
since it is not improbable that the riches of Sumatra
and Borneo are equal to those of Brazil and New
Spain. The lapse of years has by no means weakened
the force of this observation, for Borneo, Celebes,
and indeed the greater portion of these islands are
still unknown, and the government is as indifferent
now to these countries, equal in riches, and superior
in commercial advantages to the new world. The
apathy of two centuries still reign supreme with
the enlightened people of England, as well as their
Government, and whilst they willingly make the
most expensive efforts favourable to science, commerce,
or Christianity in other quarters, the locality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
which eminently combines these three objects is
alone neglected and alone uncared for.</p>

<p>It has unfortunately been the fate of our Indian
possessions to have laboured under the prejudice and
contempt of a large portion of the well-bred community,
for whilst the folly of fashion requires an
acquaintance with the deserts of Africa, and a most
ardent thirst for a knowledge of the usages of Timbuctoo,
it at the same time justifies the most profound
ignorance of all matters connected with the
government and geography of our vast possessions in
Hindostan. The Indian Archipelago has fully shared
this neglect, for even the tender philanthropy of the
present day, which originates such multifarious
schemes for the amelioration of doubtful evils, and
which shudders at the prolongation of apprenticeship
in the West for a single year, is blind to the existence
of slavery in its worst and most exaggerated form in
the East. Not a single prospectus is spread abroad,
not a single voice upraised in Exeter Hall, to relieve
the darkness of paganism and the horrors of the slave
trade. Whilst the trumpet tongue of many an orator
excites thousands to the rational and charitable object
of converting the Jews and reclaiming the gipsies;
whilst the admirable exertions of missionary enterprise
in the Ausonian climes of the South Sea have invested
them with worldly power as well as religious influence;
whilst the benevolent plans of the New Zealand
Association contemplate the protection of the natives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
by the acquisition of their territory: whilst we admire
the torrent of devotional and philosophical exertion,
we cannot help deploring that the zeal and attention
of the leaders of these charitable crusades have
never been directed to the countries under consideration.
These unhappy countries have failed to
rouse attention or excite commiseration, and as they
sink lower and lower, they afford a striking proof
how civilisation may be crushed, and how the fairest
and richest lands under the sun may become degraded
by a continuous course of oppression and misrule.</p>

<p>It is under these circumstances I have considered
that individual exertions may be usefully applied to
rouse the zeal of slumbering philanthropy, and lead
the way to an increased knowledge of the Indian
Archipelago.</p>

<p>Such an exertion will be made at some cost and
some sacrifice, and I shall here quit the general
topic, and confine myself to the specific objects of
my intended voyage. It must be premised, however,
that any plan previously decided on must
always be subject, during its execution, to great
modification, in countries where the population is
always wild and often hostile, and where the influence
of climate is sometimes fatally opposed to the
progress of inquiry. Local information, likewise,
frequently renders a change both advisable and advantageous,
and circumstances, as they spring up,
too often influence beyond the power of foresight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
especially in my own case, where the utmost care
will still leave the means very inadequate to the full
accomplishment of the proposed undertaking.</p>

<p>With a small vessel properly equipped, and provided
with the necessary instruments for observation, and the
means for collecting specimens in Natural History,
it is proposed, in the first place, to proceed to
Singapore, which may be considered the headquarters
for the necessary intervals of refreshment, and for
keeping open a certain communication with Europe.
Here, the best local information can be obtained,
interpreters procured, the crew augmented for any
particular service, and, if needful, a small vessel of
native construction may be added to the expedition
to facilitate the objects in view. An acquaintance
may likewise be formed with the more respectable
of the Bugis merchants, and their good-will conciliated
in the usual mode, viz., by civility and
presents, so as to remove any misconceived jealousy
on the score of trading rivalry, and to induce a
favourable report of our friendly intentions in their
own country, and at the places where they may
touch. The <em>Royalist</em><a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> will probably reach Singapore
in the month of February or March 1839, at the
latter end of the N.E. or rainy monsoon. The
delay consequent on effecting the objects above mentioned,
besides gaining a general acquaintance with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
the natural history and trade of the settlement, and
some knowledge of the Malay language, will usefully
occupy the time until the setting in of the S.W. or
dry monsoon. It may be incidentally mentioned,
however, that, in the vicinity of Singapore, there
are many islands imperfectly known, and which,
during the interval of the rainy season, will afford
interesting occupation. I allude more especially to
the space between the Straits of Rhio and those of
the Durien, and likewise to the island of Bintang,
which, although laid down as one large island, is
probably composed of small ones, a better acquaintance
with which might facilitate the voyage from
Singapore to the eastward, by bringing to light
other passages besides those of Rhio and Durien,
and at any rate would add something to the knowledge
of the country in the immediate vicinity of
our settlement. On the commencement of the
healthy season, I purpose sailing from Singapore,
and proceeding without loss of time to Malludu
Bay. This spot has been chosen for our first
essay for reasons previously enumerated, and in a
country every part of which is highly interesting,
the mere fact of its being a British possession
gives it a prior claim to attention. The objects
in view may be briefly mentioned.</p>

<p>1st. A general knowledge of the bay, and the
correct position of its various points, so as to determine
its outline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>2nd. To make inquiries of the settlement of
Cochin-Chinese, reported, on Earl’s authority, to
be fixed in the neighbourhood of Bankoka. (An
intercourse will if possible be opened with this
settlement.)</p>

<p>3rd. Carefully and minutely to explore the rivers
which flow into the bay, and to penetrate, if practicable,
as far as the lake and mountain of Keeny Balloo.</p>

<p>4th. Every endeavour will be used to open a communication
with the aboriginal inhabitants, and to
conciliate their good opinion. I speak with great
diffidence about penetrating into the interior of this
country, for I am well aware of the insurmountable
difficulties which the hard reality often presents,
previously overlooked, or easily overcome on the
smoothness of paper, or in the luxury of a drawing-room.
The two points chiefly to be relied on for this
purpose are a friendly intercourse with the natives,
and the existence of navigable rivers. It is mentioned
by Sir Stamford Raffles, on native authority, that a
land communication of not more than forty miles
exists between Malludu Bay and Keeny Balloo, but
neither this computation, nor any other derived from
the natives, can be relied on, for the inhabitants of
these countries are generally ignorant of any measure
of distance, and their reckoning by time is so vague
as to defy a moderately certain conclusion. The fact,
however, of the vicinity of the lake to the bay is
certain, and it follows as a reasonable inference that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
the river or rivers flowing into the bay communicate
with the lake. The existence of such rivers, which
were from the locality to be expected, are mentioned
by Captain Forrest.</p>

<p>Most of this north part of Borneo (he says), granted
to the East India Company by the Sulus, is watered
by noble rivers; those that discharge themselves
into Malludu Bay are not barred. It is by one or
the other of these rivers that I shall hope to penetrate
as far as the lake and mountain of Keeny Balloo,
and into the country of the Idaan. I have not been
able to learn that any Malay towns of importance
are situated in the bight of the bay, and their absence
will render a friendly communication with the aborigines
a matter of comparative ease. The advantages
likely to result from such friendly relations are so
evident, that I need not dwell upon them, though
the mode of effecting such an intercourse must be
left to the thousand contingencies which govern
all, and act so capriciously on the tempers of savage
races. The utmost forbearance and liberality, guided
by prudence, so as not to excite cupidity, appear the
fundamental rules for managing men in a low state
of civilisation.</p>

<p>The results of an amicable understanding are uncertain
at its commencement, for they depend on
the enterprise of the individual and the power of
the native tribe into whose hands he may chance to
fall. I will therefore not enter into a visionary field<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
of discovery, but it appears to me certain that,
without the assistance of the natives, no small party
can expect to penetrate far into a country populous
by report, and in many parts thickly wooded.
Without entertaining exaggerated expectations, I
trust that something may be added to our geographical
knowledge of the sea-coast of this bay;
its leading features, productions, river anchorages
and inhabitants; the prospects of trade and the
means of navigation; and although my wishes lead
me strongly to penetrate as far as the lake, yet the
obstacles which may be found to exist will induce
me to rest satisfied with the more moderate and
reasonable result. It may not be superfluous to
notice here that a foregone conclusion appears to
be spread abroad regarding the aboriginal (so-called)
inhabitants of Borneo, and that they are usually
considered and mentioned under the somewhat vague
appellation of Dyaks. They are likewise commonly
pronounced as originating from the same stock as
the Arafuras of Celebes and New Guinea, and
radically identical with the Polynesian race. The
conclusion is not in itself highly improbable, but
certainly premature, as the facts upon which it is
built are so scanty and doubtful as to warrant no
such structure. On an island so vast as Borneo,
races radically distinct might exist, and at any rate
the opposite conclusion is hardly justifiable from the
specimens of language, or the physical appearance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
the tribes of the southern portion of the country.
We have Malay authorities for believing that there
are many large tribes in the interior, differing greatly
in their degree of civilisation, though all alike removed
from the vicinity of a superior people. We
have the Dyaks of the south, the Idaan of the north,
the Kayan warriors and the Punan, a race little better
than monkeys, who live in trees, eat without cooking,
are hunted by the other tribes, and would seem
to exist in the lowest conceivable grade of humanity.
If we can trust these accounts, the latter people resemble
in many particulars the Orang Benua, or
aborigines of the Peninsula, but the Dyaks and
Idaans are far superior, living in villages, cultivating
the ground and possessing cattle; besides these,
we have the names of several other tribes and
people, and in all probability many exist in the
interior with whom we are yet unacquainted.</p>

<p>There are strong reasons for believing that the
Hindoo religion, which obtained so extensively in
Java and Sumatra, and yet survives in Balli and
Lombok, was likewise extended to Borneo, and
some authors have conceived grounds for supposing
a religion anterior even to this. If only a portion
of these floating opinions should be true, and the
truth can only be tested by inquiry, we may fairly
look for the descendants of the Hindoo dynasty as
well as an aboriginal people. It never seems to have
occurred to anyone to compare the Dyaks with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
people of Balli and Lombok; we know indeed little
of the former, but both races are fair, good-looking
and gentle. Again, respecting the concluded identity
of the Dyaks and Arafuras; it is clear we have a
very limited knowledge of the former, and, I may ask,
what do we know of the Arafuras? In short, I feel
as reluctant to embrace any preconceived theory as
I am to adopt the prevailing notion on this subject,
for it requires a mass of facts, with which we are
lamentably deficient, to arrive at anything approaching
to a reasonable conclusion. To return, however,
from the above digression to the proceedings of the
<em>Royalist</em>, I would remark that it depends greatly on
the time passed in Malludu Bay whether our next
endeavour be prosecuted at Abai on the western, or
Trusan Abai on the eastern coast. The object in
visiting Abai would be chiefly to penetrate to the
lake, which, on the authority of Dalrymple and
Barton, is not very far distant thence by a water
communication; but should any success have attended
similar efforts from Malludu Bay, this project will be
needless, as the enterprise will be prosecuted to the
westward, and reach the vicinity of Abai. As
Kimanis is the limit of the British territory to the
westward, so Point Kenabantongen, situated to the
southward of the bay of Londakua (Sandakan?), forms
the eastern boundary, and a line drawn from coast
to coast between these points is represented as including
our possessions. A reference to the chart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
will show the extent to be considerable, and the
eastern coast from Malludu Bay to Point Kenabantongen
is so little known, that it is desirable to
become acquainted with its general features and
conformation, and to seek thence the means of gaining
an inlet into the interior should it be denied
at Malludu Bay. The reported proximity of Keeny
Balloo to Malludu Bay, and likewise to Abai, would
(supposing it to be anything like the size it is
affirmed) lead us to expect that it cannot be far
distant from the eastern coast, and it is reasonable
to conclude that some rivers or streams discharge
themselves into the sea, in the numerous indentations
that abound on this shore. However this
may be, the coast, with its bays, islands, and bold
headlands, is one of great interest, the careful inspection
of which as far as Point Keneonjon will
add to our knowledge. The longitude of Point
Unsong and Point Keneonjon will likewise determine
the eastern extremity of Borneo, as the latitude
of Point San Paniange will give the northern
extreme of the island.</p>

<p>Much might be added on this topic, especially on
the reputed communication by a line of lakes from
Malludu Bay to Benjar Massin, which, if true, would
in all probability place some of these lakes near
particular points of the eastern coast, as the whole
line from the relative position of the two extremes
must be on the eastern side of the island. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
reports, and the various surmises which arise from
them, are matters rather of confirmation than discussion,
and I will therefore only add that, tempted
by success, I shall not devote less than a year and a
half to this object; but in case of finding a sickly
climate, or meeting with a decidedly hostile population,
I shall more easily abandon the field, and turn
to others of not less interest, and perhaps less risk.</p>

<p>Equal to Borneo in riches, and superior in picturesque
beauty to any part of the Archipelago, is the
large and eccentric country of the Bugis, called
Celebes; so deep are the indentations of its coast,
that the island may be pronounced as composed of a
succession of peninsulas, nearly uniting in a common
centre in the district of Palos, and thus, by the
proximity of every part to the sea, offering great
facilities for brief and decisive inland excursions.</p>

<p>The Dutch hold possession of Macassar, and
formerly had settlements on the north-west coast
and in the Bay of Sawa; their power appears never
to have been very extensively acknowledged, and at
present I have not been able to find any account of
the condition of their factories. This information
will probably be gained at Singapore, and at all events,
I am by no means ambitious of frequenting their
ports further than necessity obliges, and expect but
little information from them respecting the internal
regulations of their colonial Government, or the
trade or productions of the territory under their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
sway. I propose, therefore, limiting my inquiries
to the northern and north-eastern portion of the
island, more especially the great Bay of Gunong
Tella. It is impossible to state here the direction of
these inquiries, or any definitive object to which they
should be turned, as I am acquainted with no author
who speaks of the country save in a general and
vague manner. It is reported as rich, mountainous,
strikingly beautiful, and possessed of rivers abounding
in birds, and, like Borneo, inhabited by wild tribes
in the interior, and by the Bugis on the seashores
and entrances of rivers. The character of the Bugis,
so variously represented, gives me strong hopes of
rendering them, by care and kindness, useful instruments
in the prosecution of these researches, for all
writers agree that they are hardy, active, enterprising
and commercial, and it is seldom that a people
possessing such characteristics are deaf to the suggestions
of self-interest and kindly feeling.</p>

<p>The arrogance and especially the indolence of the
Malays counteract the influence of these strong incentives,
and the impulse which governs such wild
tribes as the Dyaks and Arafuras is a dangerous
weapon which cuts all ways, and often when least
anticipated. The Bajoos (Bajaus), or sea gipsies,
are another race on whom some dependence may
be placed, particularly if they be freed from the
trammels of debt, swindled upon them by the
Malays. Mr Earl, who had a personal acquaintance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
with this tribe, and could speak their language,
always expressed to me a degree of confidence
in their good faith which must have had some
grounds.</p>

<p>I may here conclude the first stage of the expedition,
during the progress of which the headquarters
will be fixed at Singapore. During some of the
intervals I hope to see Manila, and to acquire a
cursory knowledge of the unexplored tract at the
southern extremity of Manila, called in Norries’
general chart the Tiger Islands. The time devoted
to the objects above mentioned must, as I have
before said, be regulated by the degree of fortune
which attends them; for, cheered by success, I
should not readily abandon the field; yet, if persecuted
by climate or other serious detriments, I shall
frequently shift the ground to remove myself beyond
such evil influence. It is scarcely needful to continue
a detail of projects so distant, having already carved
out for myself a work which I should be proud to
perform, and which is already as extended as the
chances of human life and human resolves will
warrant.</p>

<p>The continuation of the voyage would lead me to
take the <em>Royalist</em> to Timor or Port Essington, thence
making excursions to the Aru Isles, Timor Laut,
and the southern shores of North Guinea. That
part of the coast contiguous to Torres Straits I
am particularly desirous of visiting, as it has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
suggested to me by Mr Earl, and I think with
reason, that a better channel than the one we are
at present acquainted with may be found there.
That such a channel exists, and will be discovered
when the coast is surveyed, I entertain but little
doubt, but the navigation is hazardous, and from
the westward must be attempted with great caution.
My own proceedings must of course be regulated
by the discoveries previously made by Captain Wickham
and others, and as this gentleman has orders to
survey Torres Straits, the field may be well trodden
before I reach it. The rest of the voyage I shall
consider as one merely of pleasure, combining such
utility as circumstances will permit. It is probable
that I shall visit our Australian settlements, glance
at the Islands of the Pacific, and return to Europe
round the Horn.</p>

<p>Before concluding this long paper, I may observe
that there are points of inquiry which may be useful
to the studies of the learned, which, provided the
process may be moderately simple, I shall be willing
to make, and I shall always be happy to receive any
directions or suggestions regarding them. I allude
to observations of the tides, to geology, natural
history, etc., etc., for the general observer often
overlooks highly interesting facts from his attention
not being called to them. The specimens of natural
history will be forwarded from time to time, and
information will be sent to the Geographical Society<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
which may always, if it be of any value, be used as
freely as it is communicated. In like manner, the
objects of natural history will be open to any person
who is interested in such pursuits. I cannot but
express my regret that, from pecuniary considerations
as well as the small size of the vessel, and the
limited quantity of provisions she carries, I am unable
to take a naturalist and draughtsman, but I should
always hail with pleasure any scientific person who
happened to be in the countries at the time; and I
may venture to promise him every encouragement
and facility in the prosecution of his pursuits.</p>

<p>I embark upon the expedition with great cheerfulness,
with a strong vessel, a good crew, and the
ingredients of success, as far as the limited scale of
the undertaking will permit; and I cast myself on
the waters, like Southey’s little book; but whether
the world will know me after many days is a
question which, hoping the best, I cannot answer
with any degree of assurance.</p>

cloths, cotton yarns of all sorts, unstamped gold, Samarang arrack,
muskets, gunpowder, etc., etc. All vessels required a pass. No vessel
to carry powder or shot in greater quantity than specified in the pass.
No port was open to any vessel coming from the northward of the
Moluccas, except Batavia. No navigation was allowed to be carried on
by the vessels of Banka and Billiton, except to Palembang: no navigation
from Celebes!</p>

know that you are reading a classic.”—<cite>Literary World.</cite></p>

Mr. Crockett has given him good measure, well pressed

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
